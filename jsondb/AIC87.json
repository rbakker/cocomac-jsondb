  "Title": "The entorhinal cortex of the monkey: I. Cytoarchitectonic organization",
  "Abstract": "As an essential preliminary to a series of experimental studies of the afferent and efferent connections of the monkey\r\nentorhinal cortex, we have carried out a detailed analysis of its cytoarchitectonic organization. Primarily on the basis of\r\nfeatures observed in Nissl- and fiber-stained preparations, supplemented with Golgi-stained material and preparations stained for heavy metals by Timm's method and histochemically for acetylcholinesterase, the entorhinal cortex has been divided into seven fields that are named according to their rostrocaudal and mediolateral positions except for one rostrally located field\r\nthat is named for the prominent input that it receives from the olfactory bulb. At rostral levels, the entorhinal cortex is marked\r\nby a number of morphological inhomogeneities. The neurons tend to be organized in patches that are surrounded by large,\r\nthick, radially oriented bundles of fibers. At caudal levels, the entorhinal cortex has a more distinctly laminated appearance,\r\nreminiscent of that in the neocortex, and most of the neurons and fiber fascicles are arranged in discrete radial columns. The\r\ncortical region adjoining the entorhinal cortex laterally, which is commonly known as the \"perirhinal cortex,\" is in fact\r\ncomposed of two separate fields corresponding to areas 35 and 36 of Brodmann. Area 35 occupies the fundus and part of\r\nthe lateral aspect of the rhinal sulcus. Area 36 extends from the lateral bank of the rhinal sulcus into the inferior temporal\r\ngyrus, where it borders fields TA and TE rostrally, and field TF of the parahippocampal gyrus caudally. The surface extents\r\nof each of the entorhinal fields have been determined by making \"unfolded\" two-dimensional maps of the region and\r\nmeasuring the areas with a computerized digitizing system.",

It is for this reason, rather than any fundamental disagreement with Van Hoesen and Pandya's ('75a) description, that we have departed from their account. Indeed, our own observations on the rhesus monkey entorhinal cortex tend to support their analysis and have brought to light a number of differences in the two species......The various subfields of the entorhinal cortex that we have identified in the fascicularis monkey are illustrated in Fig. 5, ...To indicate the relative areal extents of the various fields, an unfolded map of the entire entorhinal cortex, together with areas 35 and 36, is shown in Figure 10. \" (p. 340, 342)",

    "title": "The entorhinal cortex of the monkey: I. Cytoarchitectonic organization",
    "abstract": "As an essential preliminary to a series of experimental studies of the afferent and efferent connections of the monkey\r\nentorhinal cortex, we have carried out a detailed analysis of its cytoarchitectonic organization. Primarily on the basis of\r\nfeatures observed in Nissl- and fiber-stained preparations, supplemented with Golgi-stained material and preparations stained for heavy metals by Timm's method and histochemically for acetylcholinesterase, the entorhinal cortex has been divided into seven fields that are named according to their rostrocaudal and mediolateral positions except for one rostrally located field\r\nthat is named for the prominent input that it receives from the olfactory bulb. At rostral levels, the entorhinal cortex is marked\r\nby a number of morphological inhomogeneities. The neurons tend to be organized in patches that are surrounded by large,\r\nthick, radially oriented bundles of fibers. At caudal levels, the entorhinal cortex has a more distinctly laminated appearance,\r\nreminiscent of that in the neocortex, and most of the neurons and fiber fascicles are arranged in discrete radial columns. The\r\ncortical region adjoining the entorhinal cortex laterally, which is commonly known as the \"perirhinal cortex,\" is in fact\r\ncomposed of two separate fields corresponding to areas 35 and 36 of Brodmann. Area 35 occupies the fundus and part of\r\nthe lateral aspect of the rhinal sulcus. Area 36 extends from the lateral bank of the rhinal sulcus into the inferior temporal\r\ngyrus, where it borders fields TA and TE rostrally, and field TF of the parahippocampal gyrus caudally. The surface extents\r\nof each of the entorhinal fields have been determined by making \"unfolded\" two-dimensional maps of the region and\r\nmeasuring the areas with a computerized digitizing system.",
