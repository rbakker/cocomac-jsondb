  "Title": "\"Projections from the hippocampal region to the mammillary bodies in macaque monkeys.\"",
  "Abstract": "\"A combination of anterograde and retrograde tracers mapped the direct hippocampal and parahippocampal inputs to the mammillary bodies in two species of macaque monkey. Dense projections arose from pyramidal cells in layer III of the subiculum and prosubiculum, and terminated in the medial mammillary nucleus. While there was no evidence of an input from the dentate gyrus or fields CA1-3, a small contribution arose from the presubiculum and entorhinal cortices. All of the hippocampal and parahippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies appeared to use the fornix as a route. The caudal portions of the subiculum and prosubiculum contained the greatest numbers of cells projecting to the mammillary bodies. A light contralateral projection to the medial mammillary nucleus was also observed, although this appeared to arise primarily from the more rostral portions of the subiculum and prosubiculum. There was a crude topography within the medial mammillary nucleus, with the caudal subicular projections terminating in the mid and dorsal portions of the nucleus while the rostral subicular and entorhinal projections terminated in the ventral and lateral portions of the medial nucleus. Light ipsilateral projections throughout the lateral mammillary nucleus were sometimes observed. Comparisons with related studies of the macaque brain showed that the dense hippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies arise from a population of subicular cells separate from those that project to the anterior thalamic nuclei, even though the major output from the mammillary bodies is to the anterior thalamic nuclei. Other comparisons revealed underlying similarities with the corresponding projections in the rat brain.\"",

The medial nucleus, which comprises > 90% of the volume of the mammillary bodies, can be readily distinguished as it is surrounded by a dense fibre capsule (Fig. 1). At many levels the medial nucleus can be further subdivided. Rose (1939) described three nuclei (medial, basal and intermediate) within the medial mamillary complex of Macaca mulatta. A later analysis of the macaque posterior hypothalamus (Veazey et al., 1982a) also subdivided the medial mammillary nucleus into three similar components: pars medialis, pars basalis and pars lateralis (Fig. 1). The present study uses these later designations (Veazey et al., 1982a).\"",

The cells were, for the most part, in the mid and deeper parts of layer III of the subiculum (Lorente de Nó, 1934) and were primarily pyramidal-type cells (Fig. 4). These cells were found in similar numbers across the distal–proximal extent of the subiculum and so there were equivalent numbers in subiculum a and subiculum b (Lorente de Nó, 1934). The prosubiculum also contained labelled cells. Once again, nearly all of these prosubicular cells were in layer III and were of pyramidal type. These labelled prosubicular cells formed a continuous group with those in the subiculum (Fig. 4), although there was typically less than half of the number found in the prosubiculum as in the subiculum. While the overwhelming majority of cells were in layer III, very occasional labelled cells were observed in the deeper layers of the prosubiculum and subiculum.\"",

    "title": "\"Projections from the hippocampal region to the mammillary bodies in macaque monkeys.\"",
    "abstract": "\"A combination of anterograde and retrograde tracers mapped the direct hippocampal and parahippocampal inputs to the mammillary bodies in two species of macaque monkey. Dense projections arose from pyramidal cells in layer III of the subiculum and prosubiculum, and terminated in the medial mammillary nucleus. While there was no evidence of an input from the dentate gyrus or fields CA1-3, a small contribution arose from the presubiculum and entorhinal cortices. All of the hippocampal and parahippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies appeared to use the fornix as a route. The caudal portions of the subiculum and prosubiculum contained the greatest numbers of cells projecting to the mammillary bodies. A light contralateral projection to the medial mammillary nucleus was also observed, although this appeared to arise primarily from the more rostral portions of the subiculum and prosubiculum. There was a crude topography within the medial mammillary nucleus, with the caudal subicular projections terminating in the mid and dorsal portions of the nucleus while the rostral subicular and entorhinal projections terminated in the ventral and lateral portions of the medial nucleus. Light ipsilateral projections throughout the lateral mammillary nucleus were sometimes observed. Comparisons with related studies of the macaque brain showed that the dense hippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies arise from a population of subicular cells separate from those that project to the anterior thalamic nuclei, even though the major output from the mammillary bodies is to the anterior thalamic nuclei. Other comparisons revealed underlying similarities with the corresponding projections in the rat brain.\"",
