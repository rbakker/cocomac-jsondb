  "Title": "Organization of connections between the amygdaloid complex and the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices in macaque monkeys",
  "Abstract": "Neuroanatomical studies in macaque monkeys have demonstrated that the perirhinal and parahippocampal (PRPH) cortices are strongly interconnected with the hippocampal formation. Recent behavioral evidence indicates that these cortical regions are importantly involved in normal recognition memory function. The PRPH cortices are also interconnected with the amygdaloid complex, although comparatively little is known about the precise topography of these connections. We investigated the topographic organization of reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the PRPH cortices by placing anterograde and retrograde tracers throughout these three regions. We found that there was an organized arrangement of connections between the amygdala and the PRPH cortices and that the deep (lateral, basal, and accessory basal) nuclei of the amygdaloid complex were the source of most connections between the amygdala and the PRPH cortices. The temporal polar regions of the perirhinal cortex had the strongest and most widespread interconnections with the amygdala. Connections from more caudal levels of the perirhinal cortex had a more discrete pattern of termination. Perirhinal inputs to the amygdala terminated primarily in the lateral nucleus, the magnocellular and parvicellular divisions of the basal nucleus, and the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus. Return projections originated predominately in the lateral nucleus, the intermediate and parvicellular divisions of the basal nucleus, and the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus. The interconnections between the amygdala and the parahippocampal cortex were substantially less robust than those with the perirhinal cortex and mainly involved the basal nucleus. Area TF was more strongly interconnected with the amygdala than was area TH. Input from the parahippocampal cortex terminated predominantly in the lateral half of the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus but also to a lesser extent in the magnocellular division of the basal nucleus and the lateral nucleus. Return projections originated predominantly in the magnocellular division of the basal nucleus and were directed almost exclusively to area TF.",

(1987) as slightly modified by Amaral and Bassett (1989) and Pitkänen and Amaral (unpublished observations). Briefly, the \"deep\" nuclei consist of the lateral, basal, accessory basal, and paralaminar nuclei. The lateral nucleus is composed of the dorsal, dorsal intermediate, ventral, and ventral intermediate subdivisions. The basal nucleus is subdivided into magnocellular , intermediate, and parvicellular divisions, and the accessory basal nucleus is parcelled into magnocellular, parvicellular, and ventromedial divisions. The \"cortical\" nuclei consist of the anterior and posterior cortical nuclei, the periamygdaloid cortex, the medial nucleus, and the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. \"Other\" nuclei are the central nucleus (medial and lateral divivsions), the anterior amygdaloid area, the intercalated nuclei, and the amygdalohippocampal area. The locations of these amygdaloid nuclei are shown in Figure 1.\r\nPRPH cortices.  The PRPH cortices in the macaque monkey are located on the ventromedial surface of the temporal lobe, lateral and immediately caudal to the rhinal sulcus. The PRPH cortices are named according to the nomenclature of Suzuki and Amaral (1994b) and Insausti et al. (1987). Briefly, the perirhinal cortex is composed of a narrow, medially placed area 35 and a larger, more laterally placed area 36. The most rostral portion of area 35 is located on the temporal pole. There are five subdivisions of area 36: area 36d, which lies on the temporal pole; area 36r, part of which lies on the temporal pole and which is further subdivided into area 36rm (medial) and 36rl (lateral); and a caudally placed area 36c, which is subdivided into areas 36 cl and 36 cm. References to the \"rostral most\" or \"polar\" portion of the perirhinal cortex refer to those perirhnal regions that lie on the temporal pole: rostral 35, 36d, and rostral 36r. The parahippocampal cortex lies just caudally to the perirhinal cortex and is composed of two major cytoarchitectonic areas: TH, which is medially situated and a larger area TF, which lies lateral to area TH and is made up of areas TFm (medial) and TFl (lateral). The locations and the cytoarchitecture of the PRPH cortices are shown in Figure 2.\" (pp. 554-555)",

Also note that SSA96 neither show nor describe an area PAC1. This is important, because in AB89 it is included in AB89-PACs, whereas PA98 describes it!",

References to the \"rostral most\" or \"polar\" portion of the perirhinal cortex refer to those perirhnal regions that lie on the temporal pole: rostral 35, 36d, and rostral 36r. The parahippocampal cortex lies just caudally to the perirhinal cortex and is composed of two major cytoarchitectonic areas: TH, which is medially situated and a larger area TF, which lies lateral to area TH and is made up of areas TFm (medial) and TFl (lateral).

The PRPH cortices are named according to the nomenclature of Suzuki and Amaral (1994b) and Insausti et al. (1987). Briefly, the perirhinal cortex is composed of a narrow, medially placed area 35 and a larger, more laterally placed area 36. The most rostral portion of area 35 is located on the temporal pole. There are five subdivisions of area 36: area 36d, which lies on the temporal pole; area 36r, part of which lies on the temporal pole and which is further subdivided into area 36rm (medial) and 36rl (lateral); and a caudally placed area 36c, which is subdivided into areas 36 cl and 36 cm. References to the \"rostral most\" or \"polar\" portion of the perirhinal cortex refer to those perirhnal regions that lie on the temporal pole: rostral 35, 36d, and rostral 36r. The parahippocampal cortex lies just caudally to the perirhinal cortex and is composed of two major cytoarchitectonic areas: TH, which is medially situated and a larger area TF, which lies lateral to area TH and is made up of areas TFm (medial) and TFl (lateral).

As illustrated  in Figure 11, retrogradely labeled cells were observed throughout the perirhinal cortex after injections into the amygdaloid complex. When the injection was placed into rostral levels of the lateral nucleus, the heaviest densities of retrogradely labeled cells were in both the polar and ventrocaudal portions of area 36r (Fig. 11A, B). However, when the injection was placed more caudally in the lateral nucleus, the retrograde labeling was observed predominatly in the temporal polar portion of the perirhinal cortex (Fig. 11C,D).\r\nWhen retrograde tracer injections were placed into the accessory basal nucleus, the heaviest density of retrograde labeling was in the temporal polar portion of perirhinal cortex and a lower density of cells was observed in more ventrocaudal divisions of the perirhinal cortex (Fig. 11E). Consistent with the relatively meager anterograde projections that we observed to the parvicellular division of the accessory basal nucleus (Figs. 4-6), a retrograde tracer injection focused in the parvicellular division of the accessory basal nucleus led to far fewer labeled cells in the perirhinal cortex than the injection into magnocellular division    (cf. Fig. 11E,F). \" (p. 557)\r\n\"Retrograde injections that involcved the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions of the lateral nucleus led to widespread and heavy labeling throughout the perirhinal cortex (Fig. 11A,B). However, when a retrograde tracer was placed into the ventral intermediate (Fig. 11C) or ventral (Fig. 11D) division of the lateral nucleus, the same region where we saw little anterograde tracer labeling, there were fairly high densities of retrogradely labeled cells in the temporal polar perirhinal cortex.\" (p. 564)",

    "title": "Organization of connections between the amygdaloid complex and the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices in macaque monkeys",
    "abstract": "Neuroanatomical studies in macaque monkeys have demonstrated that the perirhinal and parahippocampal (PRPH) cortices are strongly interconnected with the hippocampal formation. Recent behavioral evidence indicates that these cortical regions are importantly involved in normal recognition memory function. The PRPH cortices are also interconnected with the amygdaloid complex, although comparatively little is known about the precise topography of these connections. We investigated the topographic organization of reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the PRPH cortices by placing anterograde and retrograde tracers throughout these three regions. We found that there was an organized arrangement of connections between the amygdala and the PRPH cortices and that the deep (lateral, basal, and accessory basal) nuclei of the amygdaloid complex were the source of most connections between the amygdala and the PRPH cortices. The temporal polar regions of the perirhinal cortex had the strongest and most widespread interconnections with the amygdala. Connections from more caudal levels of the perirhinal cortex had a more discrete pattern of termination. Perirhinal inputs to the amygdala terminated primarily in the lateral nucleus, the magnocellular and parvicellular divisions of the basal nucleus, and the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus. Return projections originated predominately in the lateral nucleus, the intermediate and parvicellular divisions of the basal nucleus, and the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus. The interconnections between the amygdala and the parahippocampal cortex were substantially less robust than those with the perirhinal cortex and mainly involved the basal nucleus. Area TF was more strongly interconnected with the amygdala than was area TH. Input from the parahippocampal cortex terminated predominantly in the lateral half of the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus but also to a lesser extent in the magnocellular division of the basal nucleus and the lateral nucleus. Return projections originated predominantly in the magnocellular division of the basal nucleus and were directed almost exclusively to area TF.",
