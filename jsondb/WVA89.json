  "Title": "Topographical organization of the entorhinal projection to the dentate gyrus of the monkey",
  "Abstract": "The topographic organization of the projections from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus in the macaque monkey was studied with anterograde and retrograde tracing methods. Injections of WGA-HRP or the fluorescent retrograde tracers, Fast blue and Diamidino yellow, were placed at various levels along the rostrocaudal axis of the dentate gyrus and hippocampus. In 5 experiments the fluorescent dyes were injected at 2 rostrocaudal levels of the same dentate gyrus. Labeled neurons were observed mainly in layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex, though some were also seen in layers V and VI. The labeled layer II cells resulting from each of the tracer injections were located throughout much of the rostrocaudal extent of the entorhinal cortex, though they tended to have a more limited distribution in the transverse or mediolateral axis. Injections of retrograde tracers located caudally in the dentate gyrus resulted in a rostrocaudally oriented zone of labeled cells that was situated laterally in the entorhinal cortex adjacent to the rhinal sulcus. The zone of labeled cells was not oriented strictly parallel to the rhinal sulcus since at caudal levels it extended medially to encompass the full transverse extent of the most caudal portion of the entorhinal cortex. When injections were placed more rostrally in the dentate gyrus and hippocampus, the rostrocaudally oriented zone of labeled cells was situated more medially in the entorhinal cortex. Anterograde tracing experiments using 3H-amino acid injections into different rostrocaudal and mediolateral positions of the entorhinal cortex confirmed the organization demonstrated by the retrograde tracers and further indicated that the entorhinal fibers terminate in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Unlike in the rat, where the entorhinal termination zone in the molecular layer is clearly bilaminate, projections from all portions of the entorhinal cortex appeared to terminate more diffusely throughout the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer. The results of the present study indicate that rostrocaudally oriented zones of cells that cut across several cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex give rise to topographically organized projections to the dentate gyrus. Cells located laterally in the entorhinal cortex project to caudal levels of the dentate gyrus, whereas progressively more medially situated cells project to progressively more rostral parts of the dentate gyrus.",

While this description was initially applied only to the fascicularis brain, analysis of frontal sections through the rhesus monkey entorhinal cortex stained with Nissl or fiber methods, by the Timm's sulfide silver method for the presence of heavy metals, or for the presence of acetycholinesterase indicates that the nomenclature is equally applicable to this species. The entorhinal cortex of both species is subdivided into 6 parts (Fig. 1A) that are arranged from rostral to caudal. Most rostrally is the olfactory division (EO), so named  because it is the only entorhinal field that receives a direct projection from the olfactory bulb. EO is bordered caudally by the lateral (El) field, that forms the medial bank of the rhinal sulcus, and the rostral field (Er). The intermediate field (Ei) is caudal to Er and is separated from the rhinal sulcus by a caudal extension of El. The subdivision of El into rostral and caudal part (Elr and Elc in Amaral et al., 1987) has been omitted in the present study. The 2 remaining fields extend across the full transverse distance of the caudal entorhinal cortex. The caudal subdivision (Ec) borders Ei and El rostrally, and is caudally replaced by the caudal limiting subdivision (Ecl).

The termininology of Demeter et al. (1985) was appropriate for this purpose. In this nomenclature, the dentate gyrus and hippocampus can be characterized as having 3 major regions: the uncal portion, the genu and the body (Fig. 1B). The uncal portion is the most medial part of the hippocampus that is located at the rostral limit of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle where the hippocampus and dentate gyrus bend medially and then caudally and form part of the uncus. The uncal portion of the dentate gyrus and hippocampus constitutes the most rostral extent of these fields. The genu is the flexed region where the uncal portion is continuous with the main portion or body of the hippocampus. In frontal sections it is characterized by a ring-like arrangement of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. The body of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus makes up the major portion of these fields and can be subdivided into rostral, intermediate, and caudal parts. The rostral part of the body of the hippocampus is essentially the portion associated with the optic tract, whereas the intermediate part is associated with the lateral geniculate nucleus and the caudal part extends caudal to the lateral genicualte nucleus. We should emphasize that these are purely arbitrary terms that we are using to facilitate the description of projections to different rostrocaudal levels of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. There are no obvious cytoarchitectonic differences at different rostrocaudal levels of the hippocampus or dentate gyrus that would allow assignment to one of the portions named above.\" (pp. 217-218).",

While this description was initially applied only to the fascicularis brain, analysis of frontal sections through the rhesus monkey entorhinal cortex stained with Nissl or fiber methods, by the Timm's sulfide silver method for the presence of heavy metals, or for the presence of acetycholinesterase indicates that the nomenclature is equally applicable to this species. The entorhinal cortex of both species is subdivided into 6 parts (Fig. 1A) that are arranged from rostral to caudal. Most rostrally is the olfactory division (EO), so named because it is the only entorhinal field that receives a direct projection from the olfactory bulb. EO is bordered caudally by the lateral (El) field, that forms the medial bank of the rhinal sulcus, and the rostral field (Er). The intermediate field (Ei) is caudal to Er and is separated from the rhinal sulcus by a caudal extension of El. The subdivision of El into rostral and caudal part (Elr and Elc in Amaral et al., 1987) has been omitted in the present study. The 2 remaining fields extend across the full transverse distance of the caudal entorhinal cortex.

The termininology of Demeter et al. (1985) was appropriate for this purpose. In this nomenclature, the dentate gyrus and hippocampus can be characterized as having 3 major regions: the uncal portion, the genu and the body (Fig. 1B). The uncal portion is the most medial part of the hippocampus that is located at the rostral limit of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle where the hippocampus and dentate gyrus bend medially and then caudally and form part of the uncus. The uncal portion of the dentate gyrus and hippocampus constitutes the most rostral extent of these fields.

While this description was initially applied only to the fascicularis brain, analysis of frontal sections through the rhesus monkey entorhinal cortex stained with Nissl or fiber methods, by the Timm's sulfide silver method for the presence of heavy metals, or for the presence of acetycholinesterase indicates that the nomenclature is equally applicable to this species. The entorhinal cortex of both species is subdivided into 6 parts (Fig. 1A) that are arranged from rostral to caudal. Most rostrally is the olfactory division (EO), so named because it is the only entorhinal field that receives a direct projection from the olfactory bulb. EO is bordered caudally by the lateral (El) field, that forms the medial bank of the rhinal sulcus, and the rostral field (Er). The intermediate field (Ei) is caudal to Er and is separated from the rhinal sulcus by a caudal extension of El. The subdivision of El into rostral and caudal part (Elr and Elc in Amaral et al., 1987) has been omitted in the present study. The 2 remaining fields extend across the full transverse distance of the caudal entorhinal cortex.

The termininology of Demeter et al. (1985) was appropriate for this purpose. In this nomenclature, the dentate gyrus and hippocampus can be characterized as having 3 major regions: the uncal portion, the genu and the body (Fig. 1B). The uncal portion is the most medial part of the hippocampus that is located at the rostral limit of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle where the hippocampus and dentate gyrus bend medially and then caudally and form part of the uncus. The uncal portion of the dentate gyrus and hippocampus constitutes the most rostral extent of these fields.

As it becomes clear that the entorhinal projection to the dentate gyrus is topographically organized in relation to the rostrocaudal or longitudinal extent of the dentate gyrus, it became necessary to adopt a nomenclature that would allow reference to be made to different positions along this axis. The termininology of Demeter et al. (1985) was appropriate for this purpose. In this nomenclature, the dentate gyrus and hippocampus can be characterized as having 3 major regions: the uncal portion, the genu and the body (Fig. 1B). The uncal portion is the most medial part of the hippocampus that is located at the rostral limit of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle where the hippocampus and dentate gyrus bend medially and then caudally and form part of the uncus. The uncal portion of the dentate gyrus and hippocampus constitutes the most rostral extent of these fields. The genu is the flexed region where the uncal portion is continuous with the main portion or body of the hippocampus. In frontal sections it is characterized by a ring-like arrangement of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. The body of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus makes up the major portion of these fields and can be subdivided into rostral, intermediate, and caudal parts. The rostral part of the body of the hippocampus is essentially the portion associated with the optic tract, whereas the intermediate part is associated with the lateral geniculate nucleus and the caudal part extends caudal to the lateral genicualte nucleus. We should emphasize that these are purely arbitrary terms that we are using to facilitate the description of projections to different rostrocaudal levels of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. There are no obvious cytoarchitectonic differences at different rostrocaudal levels of the hippocampus or dentate gyrus that would allow assignment to one of the portions named above.\" (pp. 217-218).",

In frontal sections it is characterized by a ring-like arrangement of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. The body of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus makes up the major portion of these fields and can be subdivided into rostral, intermediate, and caudal parts. The rostral part of the body of the hippocampus is essentially the portion associated with the optic tract, whereas the intermediate part is associated with the lateral geniculate nucleus and the caudal part extends caudal to the lateral genicualte nucleus. We should emphasize that these are purely arbitrary terms that we are using to facilitate the description of projections to different rostrocaudal levels of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. There are no obvious cytoarchitectonic differences at different rostrocaudal levels of the hippocampus or dentate gyrus that would allow assignment to one of the portions named above.\" (pp. 217-218).",
      "Comments": "The term \"hippocampus\" has been often used for the description of experimental data in this paper without defining which areas it contains. It seems that it corresponds to the ammonic areas CA1-4 of DRV85, which is often called  the \"hippocampus proper\" (CA1-CA4) by other authors, but which is not identical with the \"hippocampal formation\" (hippocampus proper, Sub, DG).",

          "Citation": "\"All of the 3H-amino acid injections into the entorhinal cortex resulted in prominent anterograde labeling in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. While there was additional heavy labeling of the subiculum and hippocampus, we will not describe these projections in this report. Unlike in the rat and cat, projections to the dentate gyrus were generally not confined to either the middle or outer third of the molecular layer. Only in case MPQ, which had the most rostral injection, was the terminal labeling restricted to the outer third of the molecular layer. In all other cases, the region of densest terminal labeling contained silver grains that were distributed over the entire outer two-thirds of the molecular layer However, the laminar pattern of labeling was not homogeneous throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the dentate gyrus. Rostrally placed injections (i.e., those in Er and Ei) had terminal distribution patterns that were genetrally based towards the outer third of the molecular layer, whereas injections in Ec and Ecl had patterns of terminal distribution that preferentially labeled the middle third of the molecular layer.\r\nThe results of the retrograde tracing experiments indicated that rostrocaudally arranged zones of cells that are oriented obliquely to the axis of the rhinal sulcus project to different rostrocaudal levels of the dentate gyrus. The anterograde experiment clearly confirmed this organizational pattern. We will review the overall pattern of projections demonstrated by the autoradiographic experiments by referring to the schematic illustrations in Figure 5 in 2 ways. First, we will look at the terminal patterns of experiments with injections that are located at the same rostrocaudal level in the entorhinal cortex but in different mediolateral positions. The retrograde studies indicated that the more medial injections should generally lead to labeling of the rostral dentate gyrus, while the more laterally placed injections should preferentially label caudal levels. In a second comparison, we will compare 4 groups of injections that are located at different rostrocaudal levels in the entorhinal cortex but within the same mediolateral zone. The projection pattern for each experiment in theses groups should be similar.\r\nTo examine the pattern of projections arising from different mediolateral positions within the same field of the entorhinal cortex, compare the terminal distributions of experiments DM-23, DM15, DM-32, and DM-13. Comparing the plots of terminal labeling in c, f, g, and l, it can be clearly seen that the pattern of innervation is heaviest in the uncal portion of the dentate gyrus in experiment DM-23, in the lateral part of the genu in experiment DM-15, in the rostral part of the body in DM-32, and in the caudal part of the body in case DM-13. Photomicrographs of the terminal labeling in the polar extremes of this comparison are illustrated in Figure 6. Terminal labeling in experiment DM-23 is heavy at rostral levels of the dentate gyrus (A, B) but is absent at caudal levels (C, D). In contrast, there is no labeling of teh rostral dentaet gyrus in experiment DM-13 (E, F) but heavy labeling of the caudal levels (G, H). A similar rostrocaudal shift of terminal labeling can be seen if experiments DM-25, MPI, and DM-34 are compared (Fig. 5, b, e k)\r\n\"The 14 experiments with 3H-amino acid injections can be combined into 4 groups based on their patterns of terminal labeling in the dentate gyrus. Taken together, the areas encompassed by the injection sites in each group form rostrocaudally oriented zones that are oblique to the rhinal sulcus and reminiscent of the zones of labeled cells found in the retrograde studies.\r\nThe first group includes experiments MPQ, DM-25, and DM-23. While each of these injections is centered in a different subdivision of the entorhinal cortex, they nonetheless all label projections that terminate mainly in the uncal portion of the dentate gyrus. The second group includes experiments DM-38, MPI, and DM-15. Again, despite the fact that the injection sites range from Er to Ec, the pattern of terminal labeling , which is focused in the lateral part of the genu and the most rostral portion of the body of the dentate gyrus, is very similar in the 3 cases. The third group of cases includes experiments DM-32, MPV, and DM-17. The injections in these cases are situated caudally in the entorhinal cortex and approximately midway along the transverse axis. While labeling is fairly extensive in these cases, the region of highest density of termination in the intermediate portion of the body of the dentate gyrus is similar in all 3 experiments. Finally, there is a group of experiments in which the injections were located far laterally in the entorhinal cortex adjacent to the rhinal sucus. This group includes experiments M-10-87, DM-34, DM-13, and MME. In each of these cases the density of terminal innervation is heaviest in the caudal part of the body of the dentate gyrus.

While there was additional heavy labeling of the subiculum and hippocampus, we will not describe these projections in this report. Unlike in the rat and cat, projections to the dentate gyrus were generally not confined to either the middle or outer third of the molecular layer. Only in case MPQ, which had the most rostral injection, was the terminal labeling restricted to the outer third of the molecular layer. In all other cases, the region of densest terminal labeling contained silver grains that were distributed over the entire outer two-thirds of the molecular layer However, the laminar pattern of labeling was not homogeneous throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the dentate gyrus. Rostrally placed injections (i.e., those in Er and Ei) had terminal distribution patterns that were genetrally based towards the outer third of the molecular layer, whereas injections in Ec and Ecl had patterns of terminal distribution that preferentially labeled the middle third of the molecular layer.\r\nThe results of the retrograde tracing experiments indicated that rostrocaudally arranged zones of cells that are oriented obliquely to the axis of the rhinal sulcus project to different rostrocaudal levels of the dentate gyrus. The anterograde experiment clearly confirmed this organizational pattern. We will review the overall pattern of projections demonstrated by the autoradiographic experiments by referring to the schematic illustrations in Figure 5 in 2 ways. First, we will look at the terminal patterns of experiments with injections that are located at the same rostrocaudal level in the entorhinal cortex but in different mediolateral positions. The retrograde studies indicated that the more medial injections should generally lead to labeling of the rostral dentate gyrus, while the more laterally placed injections should preferentially label caudal levels. In a second comparison, we will compare 4 groups of injections that are located at different rostrocaudal levels in the entorhinal cortex but within the same mediolateral zone. The projection pattern for each experiment in theses groups should be similar.\r\nTo examine the pattern of projections arising from different mediolateral positions within the same field of the entorhinal cortex, compare the terminal distributions of experiments DM-23, DM15, DM-32, and DM-13. Comparing the plots of terminal labeling in c, f, g, and l, it can be clearly seen that the pattern of innervation is heaviest in the uncal portion of the dentate gyrus in experiment DM-23, in the lateral part of the genu in experiment DM-15, in the rostral part of the body in DM-32, and in the caudal part of the body in case DM-13. Photomicrographs of the terminal labeling in the polar extremes of this comparison are illustrated in Figure 6. Terminal labeling in experiment DM-23 is heavy at rostral levels of the dentate gyrus (A, B) but is absent at caudal levels (C, D). In contrast, there is no labeling of teh rostral dentaet gyrus in experiment DM-13 (E, F) but heavy labeling of the caudal levels (G, H). A similar rostrocaudal shift of terminal labeling can be seen if experiments DM-25, MPI, and DM-34 are compared (Fig. 5, b, e k)\r\n\"The 14 experiments with 3H-amino acid injections can be combined into 4 groups based on their patterns of terminal labeling in the dentate gyrus. Taken together, the areas encompassed by the injection sites in each group form rostrocaudally oriented zones that are oblique to the rhinal sulcus and reminiscent of the zones of labeled cells found in the retrograde studies.\r\nThe first group includes experiments MPQ, DM-25, and DM-23. While each of these injections is centered in a different subdivision of the entorhinal cortex, they nonetheless all label projections that terminate mainly in the uncal portion of the dentate gyrus. The second group includes experiments DM-38, MPI, and DM-15. Again, despite the fact that the injection sites range from Er to Ec, the pattern of terminal labeling , which is focused in the lateral part of the genu and the most rostral portion of the body of the dentate gyrus, is very similar in the 3 cases. The third group of cases includes experiments DM-32, MPV, and DM-17. The injections in these cases are situated caudally in the entorhinal cortex and approximately midway along the transverse axis. While labeling is fairly extensive in these cases, the region of highest density of termination in the intermediate portion of the body of the dentate gyrus is similar in all 3 experiments. Finally, there is a group of experiments in which the injections were located far laterally in the entorhinal cortex adjacent to the rhinal sucus.

While there was additional heavy labeling of the subiculum and hippocampus, we will not describe these projections in this report. Unlike in the rat and cat, projections to the dentate gyrus were generally not confined to either the middle or outer third of the molecular layer. Only in case MPQ, which had the most rostral injection, was the terminal labeling restricted to the outer third of the molecular layer. In all other cases, the region of densest terminal labeling contained silver grains that were distributed over the entire outer two-thirds of the molecular layer However, the laminar pattern of labeling was not homogeneous throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the dentate gyrus. Rostrally placed injections (i.e., those in Er and Ei) had terminal distribution patterns that were genetrally based towards the outer third of the molecular layer, whereas injections in Ec and Ecl had patterns of terminal distribution that preferentially labeled the middle third of the molecular layer.\r\nThe results of the retrograde tracing experiments indicated that rostrocaudally arranged zones of cells that are oriented obliquely to the axis of the rhinal sulcus project to different rostrocaudal levels of the dentate gyrus. The anterograde experiment clearly confirmed this organizational pattern. We will review the overall pattern of projections demonstrated by the autoradiographic experiments by referring to the schematic illustrations in Figure 5 in 2 ways. First, we will look at the terminal patterns of experiments with injections that are located at the same rostrocaudal level in the entorhinal cortex but in different mediolateral positions. The retrograde studies indicated that the more medial injections should generally lead to labeling of the rostral dentate gyrus, while the more laterally placed injections should preferentially label caudal levels. In a second comparison, we will compare 4 groups of injections that are located at different rostrocaudal levels in the entorhinal cortex but within the same mediolateral zone. The projection pattern for each experiment in theses groups should be similar.\r\nTo examine the pattern of projections arising from different mediolateral positions within the same field of the entorhinal cortex, compare the terminal distributions of experiments DM-23, DM15, DM-32, and DM-13. Comparing the plots of terminal labeling in c, f, g, and l, it can be clearly seen that the pattern of innervation is heaviest in the uncal portion of the dentate gyrus in experiment DM-23, in the lateral part of the genu in experiment DM-15, in the rostral part of the body in DM-32, and in the caudal part of the body in case DM-13. Photomicrographs of the terminal labeling in the polar extremes of this comparison are illustrated in Figure 6. Terminal labeling in experiment DM-23 is heavy at rostral levels of the dentate gyrus (A, B) but is absent at caudal levels (C, D). In contrast, there is no labeling of teh rostral dentaet gyrus in experiment DM-13 (E, F) but heavy labeling of the caudal levels (G, H). A similar rostrocaudal shift of terminal labeling can be seen if experiments DM-25, MPI, and DM-34 are compared (Fig. 5, b, e k)\r\n\"The 14 experiments with 3H-amino acid injections can be combined into 4 groups based on their patterns of terminal labeling in the dentate gyrus.

While there was additional heavy labeling of the subiculum and hippocampus, we will not describe these projections in this report. Unlike in the rat and cat, projections to the dentate gyrus were generally not confined to either the middle or outer third of the molecular layer. Only in case MPQ, which had the most rostral injection, was the terminal labeling restricted to the outer third of the molecular layer. In all other cases, the region of densest terminal labeling contained silver grains that were distributed over the entire outer two-thirds of the molecular layer However, the laminar pattern of labeling was not homogeneous throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the dentate gyrus. Rostrally placed injections (i.e., those in Er and Ei) had terminal distribution patterns that were genetrally based towards the outer third of the molecular layer, whereas injections in Ec and Ecl had patterns of terminal distribution that preferentially labeled the middle third of the molecular layer.\r\nThe results of the retrograde tracing experiments indicated that rostrocaudally arranged zones of cells that are oriented obliquely to the axis of the rhinal sulcus project to different rostrocaudal levels of the dentate gyrus. The anterograde experiment clearly confirmed this organizational pattern. We will review the overall pattern of projections demonstrated by the autoradiographic experiments by referring to the schematic illustrations in Figure 5 in 2 ways. First, we will look at the terminal patterns of experiments with injections that are located at the same rostrocaudal level in the entorhinal cortex but in different mediolateral positions. The retrograde studies indicated that the more medial injections should generally lead to labeling of the rostral dentate gyrus, while the more laterally placed injections should preferentially label caudal levels. In a second comparison, we will compare 4 groups of injections that are located at different rostrocaudal levels in the entorhinal cortex but within the same mediolateral zone. The projection pattern for each experiment in theses groups should be similar.\r\nTo examine the pattern of projections arising from different mediolateral positions within the same field of the entorhinal cortex, compare the terminal distributions of experiments DM-23, DM15, DM-32, and DM-13. Comparing the plots of terminal labeling in c, f, g, and l, it can be clearly seen that the pattern of innervation is heaviest in the uncal portion of the dentate gyrus in experiment DM-23, in the lateral part of the genu in experiment DM-15, in the rostral part of the body in DM-32, and in the caudal part of the body in case DM-13. Photomicrographs of the terminal labeling in the polar extremes of this comparison are illustrated in Figure 6. Terminal labeling in experiment DM-23 is heavy at rostral levels of the dentate gyrus (A, B) but is absent at caudal levels (C, D). In contrast, there is no labeling of teh rostral dentaet gyrus in experiment DM-13 (E, F) but heavy labeling of the caudal levels (G, H). A similar rostrocaudal shift of terminal labeling can be seen if experiments DM-25, MPI, and DM-34 are compared (Fig. 5, b, e k)\r\n\"The 14 experiments with 3H-amino acid injections can be combined into 4 groups based on their patterns of terminal labeling in the dentate gyrus. Taken together, the areas encompassed by the injection sites in each group form rostrocaudally oriented zones that are oblique to the rhinal sulcus and reminiscent of the zones of labeled cells found in the retrograde studies.\r\nThe first group includes experiments MPQ, DM-25, and DM-23. While each of these injections is centered in a different subdivision of the entorhinal cortex, they nonetheless all label projections that terminate mainly in the uncal portion of the dentate gyrus. The second group includes experiments DM-38, MPI, and DM-15. Again, despite the fact that the injection sites range from Er to Ec, the pattern of terminal labeling , which is focused in the lateral part of the genu and the most rostral portion of the body of the dentate gyrus, is very similar in the 3 cases. The third group of cases includes experiments DM-32, MPV, and DM-17. The injections in these cases are situated caudally in the entorhinal cortex and approximately midway along the transverse axis. While labeling is fairly extensive in these cases, the region of highest density of termination in the intermediate portion of the body of the dentate gyrus is similar in all 3 experiments. Finally, there is a group of experiments in which the injections were located far laterally in the entorhinal cortex adjacent to the rhinal sucus. This group includes experiments M-10-87, DM-34, DM-13, and MME. In each of these cases the density of terminal innervation is heaviest in the caudal part of the body of the dentate gyrus. Thus, the pattern of labeling in these cases is similar despite the fact that the positions of the injections range from nearly the rostral pole of the entorhinal cortex (M-10-87) to its caudal pole (MME).\r\nAs a final note, we should point out that labeled cells were observed in area 35 (perirhinal cortex) in the retrograde tracer experiments where the injection involved the caudal dentate gyrus. We had 3 autoradiographic cases available for analysis that had 3H-amino acid injections in area 35 or the adjacent area 36. A representative experiment (DM-42) is illustrated in Figure 5.

First, we will look at the terminal patterns of experiments with injections that are located at the same rostrocaudal level in the entorhinal cortex but in different mediolateral positions.

While there was additional heavy labeling of the subiculum and hippocampus, we will not describe these projections in this report. Unlike in the rat and cat, projections to the dentate gyrus were generally not confined to either the middle or outer third of the molecular layer. Only in case MPQ, which had the most rostral injection, was the terminal labeling restricted to the outer third of the molecular layer. In all other cases, the region of densest terminal labeling contained silver grains that were distributed over the entire outer two-thirds of the molecular layer However, the laminar pattern of labeling was not homogeneous throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the dentate gyrus. Rostrally placed injections (i.e., those in Er and Ei) had terminal distribution patterns that were genetrally based towards the outer third of the molecular layer, whereas injections in Ec and Ecl had patterns of terminal distribution that preferentially labeled the middle third of the molecular layer.\r\nThe results of the retrograde tracing experiments indicated that rostrocaudally arranged zones of cells that are oriented obliquely to the axis of the rhinal sulcus project to different rostrocaudal levels of the dentate gyrus. The anterograde experiment clearly confirmed this organizational pattern. We will review the overall pattern of projections demonstrated by the autoradiographic experiments by referring to the schematic illustrations in Figure 5 in 2 ways. First, we will look at the terminal patterns of experiments with injections that are located at the same rostrocaudal level in the entorhinal cortex but in different mediolateral positions. The retrograde studies indicated that the more medial injections should generally lead to labeling of the rostral dentate gyrus, while the more laterally placed injections should preferentially label caudal levels. In a second comparison, we will compare 4 groups of injections that are located at different rostrocaudal levels in the entorhinal cortex but within the same mediolateral zone. The projection pattern for each experiment in theses groups should be similar.\r\nTo examine the pattern of projections arising from different mediolateral positions within the same field of the entorhinal cortex, compare the terminal distributions of experiments DM-23, DM15, DM-32, and DM-13. Comparing the plots of terminal labeling in c, f, g, and l, it can be clearly seen that the pattern of innervation is heaviest in the uncal portion of the dentate gyrus in experiment DM-23, in the lateral part of the genu in experiment DM-15, in the rostral part of the body in DM-32, and in the caudal part of the body in case DM-13. Photomicrographs of the terminal labeling in the polar extremes of this comparison are illustrated in Figure 6. Terminal labeling in experiment DM-23 is heavy at rostral levels of the dentate gyrus (A, B) but is absent at caudal levels (C, D). In contrast, there is no labeling of teh rostral dentaet gyrus in experiment DM-13 (E, F) but heavy labeling of the caudal levels (G, H). A similar rostrocaudal shift of terminal labeling can be seen if experiments DM-25, MPI, and DM-34 are compared (Fig. 5, b, e k)\r\n\"The 14 experiments with 3H-amino acid injections can be combined into 4 groups based on their patterns of terminal labeling in the dentate gyrus. Taken together, the areas encompassed by the injection sites in each group form rostrocaudally oriented zones that are oblique to the rhinal sulcus and reminiscent of the zones of labeled cells found in the retrograde studies.\r\nThe first group includes experiments MPQ, DM-25, and DM-23.

Rostrally placed injections (i.e., those in Er and Ei) had terminal distribution patterns that were genetrally based towards the outer third of the molecular layer, whereas injections in Ec and Ecl had patterns of terminal distribution that preferentially labeled the middle third of the molecular layer.\r\nThe results of the retrograde tracing experiments indicated that rostrocaudally arranged zones of cells that are oriented obliquely to the axis of the rhinal sulcus project to different rostrocaudal levels of the dentate gyrus. The anterograde experiment clearly confirmed this organizational pattern. We will review the overall pattern of projections demonstrated by the autoradiographic experiments by referring to the schematic illustrations in Figure 5 in 2 ways. First, we will look at the terminal patterns of experiments with injections that are located at the same rostrocaudal level in the entorhinal cortex but in different mediolateral positions. The retrograde studies indicated that the more medial injections should generally lead to labeling of the rostral dentate gyrus, while the more laterally placed injections should preferentially label caudal levels. In a second comparison, we will compare 4 groups of injections that are located at different rostrocaudal levels in the entorhinal cortex but within the same mediolateral zone. The projection pattern for each experiment in theses groups should be similar.\r\nTo examine the pattern of projections arising from different mediolateral positions within the same field of the entorhinal cortex, compare the terminal distributions of experiments DM-23, DM15, DM-32, and DM-13. Comparing the plots of terminal labeling in c, f, g, and l, it can be clearly seen that the pattern of innervation is heaviest in the uncal portion of the dentate gyrus in experiment DM-23, in the lateral part of the genu in experiment DM-15, in the rostral part of the body in DM-32, and in the caudal part of the body in case DM-13. Photomicrographs of the terminal labeling in the polar extremes of this comparison are illustrated in Figure 6. Terminal labeling in experiment DM-23 is heavy at rostral levels of the dentate gyrus (A, B) but is absent at caudal levels (C, D). In contrast, there is no labeling of teh rostral dentaet gyrus in experiment DM-13 (E, F) but heavy labeling of the caudal levels (G, H). A similar rostrocaudal shift of terminal labeling can be seen if experiments DM-25, MPI, and DM-34 are compared (Fig. 5, b, e k)\r\n\"The 14 experiments with 3H-amino acid injections can be combined into 4 groups based on their patterns of terminal labeling in the dentate gyrus. Taken together, the areas encompassed by the injection sites in each group form rostrocaudally oriented zones that are oblique to the rhinal sulcus and reminiscent of the zones of labeled cells found in the retrograde studies.\r\nThe first group includes experiments MPQ, DM-25, and DM-23. While each of these injections is centered in a different subdivision of the entorhinal cortex, they nonetheless all label projections that terminate mainly in the uncal portion of the dentate gyrus. The second group includes experiments DM-38, MPI, and DM-15. Again, despite the fact that the injection sites range from Er to Ec, the pattern of terminal labeling , which is focused in the lateral part of the genu and the most rostral portion of the body of the dentate gyrus, is very similar in the 3 cases. The third group of cases includes experiments DM-32, MPV, and DM-17. The injections in these cases are situated caudally in the entorhinal cortex and approximately midway along the transverse axis. While labeling is fairly extensive in these cases, the region of highest density of termination in the intermediate portion of the body of the dentate gyrus is similar in all 3 experiments. Finally, there is a group of experiments in which the injections were located far laterally in the entorhinal cortex adjacent to the rhinal sucus. This group includes experiments M-10-87, DM-34, DM-13, and MME. In each of these cases the density of terminal innervation is heaviest in the caudal part of the body of the dentate gyrus. Thus, the pattern of labeling in these cases is similar despite the fact that the positions of the injections range from nearly the rostral pole of the entorhinal cortex (M-10-87) to its caudal pole (MME).\r\nAs a final note, we should point out that labeled cells were observed in area 35 (perirhinal cortex) in the retrograde tracer experiments where the injection involved the caudal dentate gyrus. We had 3 autoradiographic cases available for analysis that had 3H-amino acid injections in area 35 or the adjacent area 36. A representative experiment (DM-42) is illustrated in Figure 5. This injection resulted in a pattern of anterograde labeling in the dentate gyrus that is comparable to those of the most lateral group of entorhinal injections. Our injections in area 36 did not produce labeling in the dentate gyrus, though there were prominent projections to the subiculum.\" (pp.221-222, 225)",

    "title": "Topographical organization of the entorhinal projection to the dentate gyrus of the monkey",
    "abstract": "The topographic organization of the projections from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus in the macaque monkey was studied with anterograde and retrograde tracing methods. Injections of WGA-HRP or the fluorescent retrograde tracers, Fast blue and Diamidino yellow, were placed at various levels along the rostrocaudal axis of the dentate gyrus and hippocampus. In 5 experiments the fluorescent dyes were injected at 2 rostrocaudal levels of the same dentate gyrus. Labeled neurons were observed mainly in layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex, though some were also seen in layers V and VI. The labeled layer II cells resulting from each of the tracer injections were located throughout much of the rostrocaudal extent of the entorhinal cortex, though they tended to have a more limited distribution in the transverse or mediolateral axis. Injections of retrograde tracers located caudally in the dentate gyrus resulted in a rostrocaudally oriented zone of labeled cells that was situated laterally in the entorhinal cortex adjacent to the rhinal sulcus. The zone of labeled cells was not oriented strictly parallel to the rhinal sulcus since at caudal levels it extended medially to encompass the full transverse extent of the most caudal portion of the entorhinal cortex. When injections were placed more rostrally in the dentate gyrus and hippocampus, the rostrocaudally oriented zone of labeled cells was situated more medially in the entorhinal cortex. Anterograde tracing experiments using 3H-amino acid injections into different rostrocaudal and mediolateral positions of the entorhinal cortex confirmed the organization demonstrated by the retrograde tracers and further indicated that the entorhinal fibers terminate in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Unlike in the rat, where the entorhinal termination zone in the molecular layer is clearly bilaminate, projections from all portions of the entorhinal cortex appeared to terminate more diffusely throughout the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer. The results of the present study indicate that rostrocaudally oriented zones of cells that cut across several cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex give rise to topographically organized projections to the dentate gyrus. Cells located laterally in the entorhinal cortex project to caudal levels of the dentate gyrus, whereas progressively more medially situated cells project to progressively more rostral parts of the dentate gyrus.",
