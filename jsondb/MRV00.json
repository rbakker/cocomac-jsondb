  "Title": "Localization of area prostriata and its projection to the cingulate motor cortex in the rhesus monkey",
  "Abstract": "Area prostriata is a poorly understood cortical area located in the anterior portion of the calcarine sulcus. It has attracted interest as a separate visual area and progenitor for the cortex of this modality. In this report we describe a direct projection from area prostriata to the rostral cingulate motor cortex (M3) that forms the fundus and lower bank of the anterior part of the cingulate sulcus. Injections of retrograde tracers in M3 resulted in labeled neurons in layers III, V and VI of prostriate cortex. However, injections of anterograde tracers in M3 did not demonstrate axon terminals in area prostriata. This connection was organized topographically such that the rostral part of M3 received input from the dorsal region of prostriate cortex, whereas middle and caudal levels of M3 received input from more ventral locations. Injections of retrograde and anterograde tracers in the caudal cingulate motor cortex (M4) did not produce labeling in prostriate cortex. Cytoarchitectural analysis confirmed the identity of area prostriata and further clarified its extent and borders with the parasubiculum of the hippocampal formation rostrally, and V1 of the visual cortex caudally. This linkage between cortex bordering V1 and cortex giving rise to a component of the corticofacial and corticospinal pathways demonstrates a more direct visuomotor route than visual association projections coursing laterally.",

The criteria of Conde (Conde, 1987) was used to assess the fluorescent injection sites (cases 1-4). Zones 0-II correspond to the effective uptake site and zone III its periphery. Injection sites 1, 2A, 2B and 4 have been characteized in former report (Morecraft and Van Hoesen, 1993, 1998). In all cases, the effective injection site was confined to the gray matter of the lower bank of the cingulate sulcus with the exception of case 3A. CAse 3A received a single injection of FB into mid-levels of area 24c. This location corresponded to the arm representation of M3 based upon the heavy labeling found in the arm representation of the primary motor cortex (M1). The solid deposit of the FB injection site (zone I) and zones II and III involved layers I-IV. In the coronal plane, the injection coursed diagonally from medial to lateral across all gray matter layers of the lower bank, ending in the ventral portion of the fundus, including 300 micrometer of subcortical matter. The white matter penetration did not involve the cingulum bundle. Case 3B received a single injection of DY in the caudal one-third of area 24c where zones 0-III were all confined to the gray matter. This location corresponded to the leg representation of M3 based upon the heavy labeling found in the leg representation of M1. In the coronal plane, the injection was located in the middle of the lower bank of the cingulate sulcus. Cases 5 and 6 received multiple injection of tritiatd amino acids in area 24c, whereas cases 7 and 8 received multile injections of the same tracer into areas 23c. In all cases, the isotope was confined to cortex lining the lower bank of the cingulate sulcus. The injection site in case 5 was extensive in the rostrocaudal direction involving most of area 24c. Case 6 involved he caudal one-half of area 24c. The injection site in case 7 involved the rostral two-thirds of area 23c and case 8 the caudal half of this same field. The BDA injections incases 9-11, and their somatotopical affiliation have als been described previously (Morecraft et al., 1996).

The criteria of Conde (Conde, 1987) was used to assess the fluorescent injection sites (cases 1-4). Zones 0-II correspond to the effective uptake site and zone III its periphery. Injection sites 1, 2A, 2B and 4 have been characteized in former report (Morecraft and Van Hoesen, 1993, 1998). In all cases, the effective injection site was confined to the gray matter of the lower bank of the cingulate sulcus with the exception of case 3A. CAse 3A received a single injection of FB into mid-levels of area 24c. This location corresponded to the arm representation of M3 based upon the heavy labeling found in the arm representation of the primary motor cortex (M1). The solid deposit of the FB injection site (zone I) and zones II and III involved layers I-IV. In the coronal plane, the injection coursed diagonally from medial to lateral across all gray matter layers of the lower bank, ending in the ventral portion of the fundus, including 300 micrometer of subcortical matter. The white matter penetration did not involve the cingulum bundle. Case 3B received a single injection of DY in the caudal one-third of area 24c where zones 0-III were all confined to the gray matter. This location corresponded to the leg representation of M3 based upon the heavy labeling found in the leg representation of M1. In the coronal plane, the injection was located in the middle of the lower bank of the cingulate sulcus. Cases 5 and 6 received multiple injection of tritiatd amino acids in area 24c, whereas cases 7 and 8 received multile injections of the same tracer into areas 23c. In all cases, the isotope was confined to cortex lining the lower bank of the cingulate sulcus. The injection site in case 5 was extensive in the rostrocaudal direction involving most of area 24c. Case 6 involved he caudal one-half of area 24c. The injection site in case 7 involved the rostral two-thirds of area 23c and case 8 the caudal half of this same field. The BDA injections incases 9-11, and their somatotopical affiliation have als been described previously (Morecraft et al., 1996). Briefly, the injection in case 9 involved the face representation of M3 and labeled terminals in the facial nucleus, whereas the injection in case 10 involved the arm representation of M3 and labeled terminals in the brachial spinal cord.

The criteria of Conde (Conde, 1987) was used to assess the fluorescent injection sites (cases 1-4). Zones 0-II correspond to the effective uptake site and zone III its periphery. Injection sites 1, 2A, 2B and 4 have been characteized in former report (Morecraft and Van Hoesen, 1993, 1998). In all cases, the effective injection site was confined to the gray matter of the lower bank of the cingulate sulcus with the exception of case 3A. CAse 3A received a single injection of FB into mid-levels of area 24c. This location corresponded to the arm representation of M3 based upon the heavy labeling found in the arm representation of the primary motor cortex (M1). The solid deposit of the FB injection site (zone I) and zones II and III involved layers I-IV. In the coronal plane, the injection coursed diagonally from medial to lateral across all gray matter layers of the lower bank, ending in the ventral portion of the fundus, including 300 micrometer of subcortical matter. The white matter penetration did not involve the cingulum bundle. Case 3B received a single injection of DY in the caudal one-third of area 24c where zones 0-III were all confined to the gray matter. This location corresponded to the leg representation of M3 based upon the heavy labeling found in the leg representation of M1. In the coronal plane, the injection was located in the middle of the lower bank of the cingulate sulcus. Cases 5 and 6 received multiple injection of tritiatd amino acids in area 24c, whereas cases 7 and 8 received multile injections of the same tracer into areas 23c. In all cases, the isotope was confined to cortex lining the lower bank of the cingulate sulcus. The injection site in case 5 was extensive in the rostrocaudal direction involving most of area 24c. Case 6 involved he caudal one-half of area 24c. The injection site in case 7 involved the rostral two-thirds of area 23c and case 8 the caudal half of this same field. The BDA injections incases 9-11, and their somatotopical affiliation have als been described previously (Morecraft et al., 1996). Briefly, the injection in case 9 involved the face representation of M3 and labeled terminals in the facial nucleus, whereas the injection in case 10 involved the arm representation of M3 and labeled terminals in the brachial spinal cord.

    "abstract": "Area prostriata is a poorly understood cortical area located in the anterior portion of the calcarine sulcus. It has attracted interest as a separate visual area and progenitor for the cortex of this modality. In this report we describe a direct projection from area prostriata to the rostral cingulate motor cortex (M3) that forms the fundus and lower bank of the anterior part of the cingulate sulcus. Injections of retrograde tracers in M3 resulted in labeled neurons in layers III, V and VI of prostriate cortex. However, injections of anterograde tracers in M3 did not demonstrate axon terminals in area prostriata. This connection was organized topographically such that the rostral part of M3 received input from the dorsal region of prostriate cortex, whereas middle and caudal levels of M3 received input from more ventral locations. Injections of retrograde and anterograde tracers in the caudal cingulate motor cortex (M4) did not produce labeling in prostriate cortex. Cytoarchitectural analysis confirmed the identity of area prostriata and further clarified its extent and borders with the parasubiculum of the hippocampal formation rostrally, and V1 of the visual cortex caudally. This linkage between cortex bordering V1 and cortex giving rise to a component of the corticofacial and corticospinal pathways demonstrates a more direct visuomotor route than visual association projections coursing laterally.",
