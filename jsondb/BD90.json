  "Title": "Projections from the amygdala to basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal regions in the rhesus monkey",
  "Abstract": "The sources of ipsilateral projections from the amygdala to basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal cortices were studied with\r\nretrograde tracers (horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent dyes) in 13 rhesus monkeys. The basoventral regions injected with tracers\r\nincluded the orbital periallocortex and proisocortex, orbital areas 13, 11, and 12, lateral area 12, and ventral area 46. The mediodorsal\r\nregions included portions of medial areas 25, 32, 14, and dorsal area 8. The above sites represent areas within two architectonic series\r\nof cortices referred to as basoventral or mediodorsal on the basis of their anatomic location. Each series consists of areas that show a\r\ngradual increase in the number of layers and their delineation in a direction from the caudal orbital and medial limbic cortices, which\r\nhave an incipient laminar organization, towards the eulaminated periarcuate cortices (Barbas and Pandya, J. Comp. Neurol. 286:\r\n353-375, '89). Labeled neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex were found in the basolateral, basomedial (also known as accessory\r\nbasal), lateral, and ventral cortical nuclei, and in the anterior amygdaloid and amygdalopiriform areas. The distribution of labeled\r\nneurons differed both quantitatively and qualitatively depending on whether the injection sites were in basoventral or mediodorsal\r\nprefrontal cortices. Cases with caudal orbital injections had the most labeled neurons in the amygdala, followed by cases with injections\r\nin cortices situated medioventrally. The latter received a high proportion of their amygdaloid projections from the basomedial nucleus.\r\nThe lateral amygdaloid nucleus sent a robust projection to the least architectonically differentiated orbital periallocortex, and a weaker\r\nprojection to the adjoining orbital proisocortical regions, but did not appear to project to either medial proisocortical sites or to the more\r\ndifferentiated ventrolateral or dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. In addition, there were topographical differences in the origin of\r\nprojections from one amygdaloid nucleus directed to various prefrontal cortices. These differences were correlated either with the\r\ndestination of the axons of afferent amygdaloid neurons to basoventral or to mediodorsal prefrontal cortices and/or with their projection\r\nto areas with varying degrees of laminar organization within the basoventral or mediodorsal sector. The clearest topography was\r\nobserved for projections originating in the basolateral nucleus. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe results indicate that the least architectonically differentiated basal sites situated in the caudal orbitofrontal region, followed by the comparable medial areas situated ventrally on the medial surface, received the strongest and most widespraed projections from the amygdala. Medial proisocortices situated more dorsally and caudally received only a few projections from the amygdala. In addition, areas with a high degree of laminar organization (caudal areas 46 and 8) within both basoventral and mediodorsal regions received few and topographically  restricted amygdaloid projections.",

          "Citation": "\"The terminology for the amygdala used in this study is based largely on the studies of Johnston ('23), and complemented when necessary with the nomenclature of Brockhaus ('40) and De Olmos ('90) for the human amygdala, and Price ('81) and Price et al. ('87) for the macaque monkey. In a comparative study Johnston ('23) subdivided the amygdala in the opossum, rat, rabbit, bat, macaque monkey, and in human embryos. Johnston's terminolgy for macaque monkey and human embryos is consistent with what he proposed for other nonprimate mammals, a procedure that was followed only partially by Crosby and Humphrey ('41) for the human amygdala, and later by Lauer ('45) in the macaque monkey. The major point of controversy concerns portions of the basal amygdaloid complex, which in the rat comprises the basomedial, basolateral, and lateral nuclei (De Olmos et al., '85; De Olmos, '90, for reviews). Johnston named the most dorsal and medial portion of the basal group the \"medial basal\" nucleus in primates. In an unexplained departure from Johnson's original account, Lauer ('45) used the name \"accessory basal\" for the same nucleus. Johnston ('23) reserved the name \"accessory basal\" for a different nucleus, which he claimed was present onlyin the oppossum among the species he had examined (see also Young, '36 for the rabbit, anfd Fox, '40 for the  cat). Mehler's ('80) hodological studies in macaque monkeys led us to suggest that the accessory basal nucleus of primates described by Lauer ('45) would be at least in part homologous to the basomedial nucleus in the rat and cat, a possibilityt hat was also entertained by Price ('81) and Amaral ('85). Moreover, Price suggested that in the monkey the parvicellular portion of the adjacent \"basal\" nucleus (Bpc in his terminology) is homologous to the smaller-celled part of the basolateral nucleus in the  rat and cat (see also Amaral,'85; Price et al., '87). Amaral ('85) suggested further  that the entire \"basal\" nucleus in primates may be homologous with the basolateral nucleus in nonprimates. On the basis of the above considerations, and in agreement with previous discussions on this topic (Koikegami, '63; De Olmos, '90), it seems reasonable to retain the earlier terminology of Johnston ('23) with regard to the most medial and dorsal member of the basolateral group (basomedial, BM) and to consider the adjacent nucleus (including the ventromedially situated parvicellular group of cells) as the basolateral (BL) nucleus (Figs. 1, 3A,B,C). This classification is consistent with the atlas of the amygdala in Macaca fuscata according to the map of Kusama and Mabuchi ('70) and with the nomenclature used for the human amygdala according to Brockhaus ('40), Nitecka and Narkiewicz, ('76),  andDe Olmos ('90).\r\nOur terminilogy for the cortical amygdaloid group requires some explanation as well. In the present account we recognize the existance of anterior (ACo) and posterior (PCo) sectors of the cortical nucleus as described by Price et al. ('87). Based on this recent parcelling of the cortical nucleus, Johnston's (23) cortical amydaloid nucleus, however, appears to lie medioventral to both ACo and PCo, and we thus use the name ventral cortical (VCo) to distinguish it from other subdivisions (fig. 1) The VCo does not seem to encompass the region variously designated the corticoamygdaloid transition area (Crosby and Humphrey, '41, '44; Lauer, '45), or the amygdalopiriform (APir) area (Humphrey, '68). However, the \"periamygdaloid cortex\" of some other authors (Rose, '27; Koikegami, '63; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87) includes both VCo and APir. We distinguish between these two regions because thymidine autoradiographic studies in the rat show developmental features consistent with those of a subcortical nuclear group formation for VCo Bayer, '80). In addition, maturation of APir seems to precede that of surrounding structures (Hilpert, '28; Brockhaus, '40; Humphrey, '68). We consider these facts to justify classificaton of APir as a separate anatomical entity distinct from VCo.\r\nBased on the above considerations, there are five groups of nuclei in the monkey amygdala: olfactory, medial, central, basal, and intrameduallary. On the basis of the hodological studies of Turner et al. ('78) describing the connectional relationship of the olfactory bulb and the amygdala in macaque monkeys, the olfactory amygdala consists of four nuclei [the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the anterior (ACo), ventral (VCo), and posterior (PCo) divisions of the cortical nuclei] and two areas [ the anterior amygdaloid  (AAA) and the amygdalopiriform (APir)]. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is small and not easily delineated in monkeys. The VCo nucleus has three subdivisions, which we refer to as the superior (S), the intermediate (It), and the inferior (If). The medial group in the monkey includes the  medial (Me) nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The central group consists only of the central (Ce) and the associated amygdaloid grisea. The basal group includes the basomedial (BM), basolateral (BL), and lateral (L) nuclei. Each of these three members of the basal group can be subdivided further into several subsectors (e.g., Amaral, '85; Price et al., Price et al., '87). The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei.\r\n\r\nThe location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1. Because the cytoarchitecture and various aspects of the chemoarchitecture of the amygdala have been described in other studies (e.g., Lauer, '45; Jimenez-Castellanos, '49; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87;Amaral and Basset, '89), they will not be described here.\" (pp. 553, 555)"

We distinguish between these two regions because thymidine autoradiographic studies in the rat show developmental features consistent with those of a subcortical nuclear group formation for VCo Bayer, '80). In addition, maturation of APir seems to precede that of surrounding structures (Hilpert, '28; Brockhaus, '40; Humphrey, '68). We consider these facts to justify classificaton of APir as a separate anatomical entity distinct from VCo. Based on the above considerations, there are five groups of nuclei in the monkey amygdala: olfactory, medial, central, basal, and intrameduallary. On the basis of the hodological studies of Turner et al. ('78) describing the connectional relationship of the olfactory bulb and the amygdala in macaque monkeys, the olfactory amygdala consists of four nuclei [the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the anterior (ACo), ventral (VCo), and posterior (PCo) divisions of the cortical nuclei] and two areas [ the anterior amygdaloid (AAA) and the amygdalopiriform (APir)]. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is small and not easily delineated in monkeys. The VCo nucleus has three subdivisions, which we refer to as the superior (S), the intermediate (It), and the inferior (If). The medial group in the monkey includes the medial (Me) nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The central group consists only of the central (Ce) and the associated amygdaloid grisea. The basal group includes the basomedial (BM), basolateral (BL), and lateral (L) nuclei. Each of these three members of the basal group can be subdivided further into several subsectors (e.g., Amaral, '85; Price et al., Price et al., '87). The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei. The location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1. Because the cytoarchitecture and various aspects of the chemoarchitecture of the amygdala have been described in other studies (e.g., Lauer, '45; Jimenez-Castellanos, '49; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87;Amaral and Basset, '89), they will not be described here.\" (pp. 553, 555)",

('87) for the macaque monkey. In a comparative study Johnston ('23) subdivided the amygdala in the opossum, rat, rabbit, bat, macaque monkey, and in human embryos. Johnston's terminolgy for macaque monkey and human embryos is consistent with what he proposed for other nonprimate mammals, a procedure that was followed only partially by Crosby and Humphrey ('41) for the human amygdala, and later by Lauer ('45) in the macaque monkey. The major point of controversy concerns portions of the basal amygdaloid complex, which in the rat comprises the basomedial, basolateral, and lateral nuclei (De Olmos et al., '85; De Olmos, '90, for reviews). Johnston named the most dorsal and medial portion of the basal group the \"medial basal\" nucleus in primates. In an unexplained departure from Johnson's original account, Lauer ('45) used the name \"accessory basal\" for the same nucleus. Johnston ('23) reserved the name \"accessory basal\" for a different nucleus, which he claimed was present onlyin the oppossum among the species he had examined (see also Young, '36 for the rabbit, anfd Fox, '40 for the cat). Mehler's ('80) hodological studies in macaque monkeys led us to suggest that the accessory basal nucleus of primates described by Lauer ('45) would be at least in part homologous to the basomedial nucleus in the rat and cat, a possibilityt hat was also entertained by Price ('81) and Amaral ('85). Moreover, Price suggested that in the monkey the parvicellular portion of the adjacent \"basal\" nucleus (Bpc in his terminology) is homologous to the smaller-celled part of the basolateral nucleus in the rat and cat (see also Amaral,'85; Price et al., '87). Amaral ('85) suggested further that the entire \"basal\" nucleus in primates may be homologous with the basolateral nucleus in nonprimates. On the basis of the above considerations, and in agreement with previous discussions on this topic (Koikegami, '63; De Olmos, '90), it seems reasonable to retain the earlier terminology of Johnston ('23) with regard to the most medial and dorsal member of the basolateral group (basomedial, BM) and to consider the adjacent nucleus (including the ventromedially situated parvicellular group of cells) as the basolateral (BL) nucleus (Figs. 1, 3A,B,C). This classification is consistent with the atlas of the amygdala in Macaca fuscata according to the map of Kusama and Mabuchi ('70) and with the nomenclature used for the human amygdala according to Brockhaus ('40), Nitecka and Narkiewicz, ('76), andDe Olmos ('90).

Johnston ('23) reserved the name \"accessory basal\" for a different nucleus, which he claimed was present onlyin the oppossum among the species he had examined (see also Young, '36 for the rabbit, anfd Fox, '40 for the cat). Mehler's ('80) hodological studies in macaque monkeys led us to suggest that the accessory basal nucleus of primates described by Lauer ('45) would be at least in part homologous to the basomedial nucleus in the rat and cat, a possibilityt hat was also entertained by Price ('81) and Amaral ('85). Moreover, Price suggested that in the monkey the parvicellular portion of the adjacent \"basal\" nucleus (Bpc in his terminology) is homologous to the smaller-celled part of the basolateral nucleus in the rat and cat (see also Amaral,'85; Price et al., '87). Amaral ('85) suggested further that the entire \"basal\" nucleus in primates may be homologous with the basolateral nucleus in nonprimates. On the basis of the above considerations, and in agreement with previous discussions on this topic (Koikegami, '63; De Olmos, '90), it seems reasonable to retain the earlier terminology of Johnston ('23) with regard to the most medial and dorsal member of the basolateral group (basomedial, BM) and to consider the adjacent nucleus (including the ventromedially situated parvicellular group of cells) as the basolateral (BL) nucleus (Figs. 1, 3A,B,C). This classification is consistent with the atlas of the amygdala in Macaca fuscata according to the map of Kusama and Mabuchi ('70) and with the nomenclature used for the human amygdala according to Brockhaus ('40), Nitecka and Narkiewicz, ('76), andDe Olmos ('90). Our terminilogy for the cortical amygdaloid group requires some explanation as well. In the present account we recognize the existance of anterior (ACo) and posterior (PCo) sectors of the cortical nucleus as described by Price et al. ('87). Based on this recent parcelling of the cortical nucleus, Johnston's (23) cortical amydaloid nucleus, however, appears to lie medioventral to both ACo and PCo, and we thus use the name ventral cortical (VCo) to distinguish it from other subdivisions (fig. 1) The VCo does not seem to encompass the region variously designated the corticoamygdaloid transition area (Crosby and Humphrey, '41, '44; Lauer, '45), or the amygdalopiriform (APir) area (Humphrey, '68). However, the \"periamygdaloid cortex\" of some other authors (Rose, '27; Koikegami, '63; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87) includes both VCo and APir. We distinguish between these two regions because thymidine autoradiographic studies in the rat show developmental features consistent with those of a subcortical nuclear group formation for VCo Bayer, '80). In addition, maturation of APir seems to precede that of surrounding structures (Hilpert, '28; Brockhaus, '40; Humphrey, '68). We consider these facts to justify classificaton of APir as a separate anatomical entity distinct from VCo. Based on the above considerations, there are five groups of nuclei in the monkey amygdala: olfactory, medial, central, basal, and intrameduallary. On the basis of the hodological studies of Turner et al. ('78) describing the connectional relationship of the olfactory bulb and the amygdala in macaque monkeys, the olfactory amygdala consists of four nuclei [the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the anterior (ACo), ventral (VCo), and posterior (PCo) divisions of the cortical nuclei] and two areas [ the anterior amygdaloid (AAA) and the amygdalopiriform (APir)]. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is small and not easily delineated in monkeys. The VCo nucleus has three subdivisions, which we refer to as the superior (S), the intermediate (It), and the inferior (If). The medial group in the monkey includes the medial (Me) nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The central group consists only of the central (Ce) and the associated amygdaloid grisea. The basal group includes the basomedial (BM), basolateral (BL), and lateral (L) nuclei. Each of these three members of the basal group can be subdivided further into several subsectors (e.g., Amaral, '85; Price et al., Price et al., '87). The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei. The location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1. Because the cytoarchitecture and various aspects of the chemoarchitecture of the amygdala have been described in other studies (e.g., Lauer, '45; Jimenez-Castellanos, '49; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87;Amaral and Basset, '89), they will not be described here.\" (pp. 553, 555)",

      "Citation": "\"The terminology for the amygdala used in this study is based largely on the studies of Johnston ('23), and complemented when necessary with the nomenclature of Brockhaus ('40) and De Olmos ('90) for the human amygdala, and Price ('81) and Price et al. ('87) for the macaque monkey. In a comparative study Johnston ('23) subdivided the amygdala in the opossum, rat, rabbit, bat, macaque monkey, and in human embryos. Johnston's terminolgy for macaque monkey and human embryos is consistent with what he proposed for other nonprimate mammals, a procedure that was followed only partially by Crosby and Humphrey ('41) for the human amygdala, and later by Lauer ('45) in the macaque monkey. The major point of controversy concerns portions of the basal amygdaloid complex, which in the rat comprises the basomedial, basolateral, and lateral nuclei (De Olmos et al., '85; De Olmos, '90, for reviews). Johnston named the most dorsal and medial portion of the basal group the \"medial basal\" nucleus in primates. In an unexplained departure from Johnson's original account, Lauer ('45) used the name \"accessory basal\" for the same nucleus. Johnston ('23) reserved the name \"accessory basal\" for a different nucleus, which he claimed was present onlyin the oppossum among the species he had examined (see also Young, '36 for the rabbit, anfd Fox, '40 for the cat). Mehler's ('80) hodological studies in macaque monkeys led us to suggest that the accessory basal nucleus of primates described by Lauer ('45) would be at least in part homologous to the basomedial nucleus in the rat and cat, a possibilityt hat was also entertained by Price ('81) and Amaral ('85). Moreover, Price suggested that in the monkey the parvicellular portion of the adjacent \"basal\" nucleus (Bpc in his terminology) is homologous to the smaller-celled part of the basolateral nucleus in the rat and cat (see also Amaral,'85; Price et al., '87). Amaral ('85) suggested further that the entire \"basal\" nucleus in primates may be homologous with the basolateral nucleus in nonprimates. On the basis of the above considerations, and in agreement with previous discussions on this topic (Koikegami, '63; De Olmos, '90), it seems reasonable to retain the earlier terminology of Johnston ('23) with regard to the most medial and dorsal member of the basolateral group (basomedial, BM) and to consider the adjacent nucleus (including the ventromedially situated parvicellular group of cells) as the basolateral (BL) nucleus (Figs. 1, 3A,B,C). This classification is consistent with the atlas of the amygdala in Macaca fuscata according to the map of Kusama and Mabuchi ('70) and with the nomenclature used for the human amygdala according to Brockhaus ('40), Nitecka and Narkiewicz, ('76), andDe Olmos ('90). Our terminilogy for the cortical amygdaloid group requires some explanation as well. In the present account we recognize the existance of anterior (ACo) and posterior (PCo) sectors of the cortical nucleus as described by Price et al. ('87). Based on this recent parcelling of the cortical nucleus, Johnston's (23) cortical amydaloid nucleus, however, appears to lie medioventral to both ACo and PCo, and we thus use the name ventral cortical (VCo) to distinguish it from other subdivisions (fig. 1) The VCo does not seem to encompass the region variously designated the corticoamygdaloid transition area (Crosby and Humphrey, '41, '44; Lauer, '45), or the amygdalopiriform (APir) area (Humphrey, '68). However, the \"periamygdaloid cortex\" of some other authors (Rose, '27; Koikegami, '63; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87) includes both VCo and APir. We distinguish between these two regions because thymidine autoradiographic studies in the rat show developmental features consistent with those of a subcortical nuclear group formation for VCo Bayer, '80). In addition, maturation of APir seems to precede that of surrounding structures (Hilpert, '28; Brockhaus, '40; Humphrey, '68). We consider these facts to justify classificaton of APir as a separate anatomical entity distinct from VCo. Based on the above considerations, there are five groups of nuclei in the monkey amygdala: olfactory, medial, central, basal, and intrameduallary. On the basis of the hodological studies of Turner et al. ('78) describing the connectional relationship of the olfactory bulb and the amygdala in macaque monkeys, the olfactory amygdala consists of four nuclei [the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the anterior (ACo), ventral (VCo), and posterior (PCo) divisions of the cortical nuclei] and two areas [ the anterior amygdaloid (AAA) and the amygdalopiriform (APir)]. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is small and not easily delineated in monkeys. The VCo nucleus has three subdivisions, which we refer to as the superior (S), the intermediate (It), and the inferior (If). The medial group in the monkey includes the medial (Me) nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The central group consists only of the central (Ce) and the associated amygdaloid grisea. The basal group includes the basomedial (BM), basolateral (BL), and lateral (L) nuclei. Each of these three members of the basal group can be subdivided further into several subsectors (e.g., Amaral, '85; Price et al., Price et al., '87). The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei. The location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1.

However, the \"periamygdaloid cortex\" of some other authors (Rose, '27; Koikegami, '63; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87) includes both VCo and APir. We distinguish between these two regions because thymidine autoradiographic studies in the rat show developmental features consistent with those of a subcortical nuclear group formation for VCo Bayer, '80). In addition, maturation of APir seems to precede that of surrounding structures (Hilpert, '28; Brockhaus, '40; Humphrey, '68). We consider these facts to justify classificaton of APir as a separate anatomical entity distinct from VCo. Based on the above considerations, there are five groups of nuclei in the monkey amygdala: olfactory, medial, central, basal, and intrameduallary. On the basis of the hodological studies of Turner et al. ('78) describing the connectional relationship of the olfactory bulb and the amygdala in macaque monkeys, the olfactory amygdala consists of four nuclei [the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the anterior (ACo), ventral (VCo), and posterior (PCo) divisions of the cortical nuclei] and two areas [ the anterior amygdaloid (AAA) and the amygdalopiriform (APir)]. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is small and not easily delineated in monkeys. The VCo nucleus has three subdivisions, which we refer to as the superior (S), the intermediate (It), and the inferior (If). The medial group in the monkey includes the medial (Me) nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The central group consists only of the central (Ce) and the associated amygdaloid grisea. The basal group includes the basomedial (BM), basolateral (BL), and lateral (L) nuclei. Each of these three members of the basal group can be subdivided further into several subsectors (e.g., Amaral, '85; Price et al., Price et al., '87). The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei. The location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1. Because the cytoarchitecture and various aspects of the chemoarchitecture of the amygdala have been described in other studies (e.g., Lauer, '45; Jimenez-Castellanos, '49; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87;Amaral and Basset, '89), they will not be described here.\" (pp. 553, 555)",

('87) for the macaque monkey. In a comparative study Johnston ('23) subdivided the amygdala in the opossum, rat, rabbit, bat, macaque monkey, and in human embryos. Johnston's terminolgy for macaque monkey and human embryos is consistent with what he proposed for other nonprimate mammals, a procedure that was followed only partially by Crosby and Humphrey ('41) for the human amygdala, and later by Lauer ('45) in the macaque monkey. The major point of controversy concerns portions of the basal amygdaloid complex, which in the rat comprises the basomedial, basolateral, and lateral nuclei (De Olmos et al., '85; De Olmos, '90, for reviews). Johnston named the most dorsal and medial portion of the basal group the \"medial basal\" nucleus in primates. In an unexplained departure from Johnson's original account, Lauer ('45) used the name \"accessory basal\" for the same nucleus. Johnston ('23) reserved the name \"accessory basal\" for a different nucleus, which he claimed was present onlyin the oppossum among the species he had examined (see also Young, '36 for the rabbit, anfd Fox, '40 for the cat). Mehler's ('80) hodological studies in macaque monkeys led us to suggest that the accessory basal nucleus of primates described by Lauer ('45) would be at least in part homologous to the basomedial nucleus in the rat and cat, a possibilityt hat was also entertained by Price ('81) and Amaral ('85). Moreover, Price suggested that in the monkey the parvicellular portion of the adjacent \"basal\" nucleus (Bpc in his terminology) is homologous to the smaller-celled part of the basolateral nucleus in the rat and cat (see also Amaral,'85; Price et al., '87). Amaral ('85) suggested further that the entire \"basal\" nucleus in primates may be homologous with the basolateral nucleus in nonprimates. On the basis of the above considerations, and in agreement with previous discussions on this topic (Koikegami, '63; De Olmos, '90), it seems reasonable to retain the earlier terminology of Johnston ('23) with regard to the most medial and dorsal member of the basolateral group (basomedial, BM) and to consider the adjacent nucleus (including the ventromedially situated parvicellular group of cells) as the basolateral (BL) nucleus (Figs. 1, 3A,B,C). This classification is consistent with the atlas of the amygdala in Macaca fuscata according to the map of Kusama and Mabuchi ('70) and with the nomenclature used for the human amygdala according to Brockhaus ('40), Nitecka and Narkiewicz, ('76), andDe Olmos ('90).

Johnston named the most dorsal and medial portion of the basal group the \"medial basal\" nucleus in primates. In an unexplained departure from Johnson's original account, Lauer ('45) used the name \"accessory basal\" for the same nucleus. Johnston ('23) reserved the name \"accessory basal\" for a different nucleus, which he claimed was present onlyin the oppossum among the species he had examined (see also Young, '36 for the rabbit, anfd Fox, '40 for the cat). Mehler's ('80) hodological studies in macaque monkeys led us to suggest that the accessory basal nucleus of primates described by Lauer ('45) would be at least in part homologous to the basomedial nucleus in the rat and cat, a possibilityt hat was also entertained by Price ('81) and Amaral ('85). Moreover, Price suggested that in the monkey the parvicellular portion of the adjacent \"basal\" nucleus (Bpc in his terminology) is homologous to the smaller-celled part of the basolateral nucleus in the rat and cat (see also Amaral,'85; Price et al., '87). Amaral ('85) suggested further that the entire \"basal\" nucleus in primates may be homologous with the basolateral nucleus in nonprimates. On the basis of the above considerations, and in agreement with previous discussions on this topic (Koikegami, '63; De Olmos, '90), it seems reasonable to retain the earlier terminology of Johnston ('23) with regard to the most medial and dorsal member of the basolateral group (basomedial, BM) and to consider the adjacent nucleus (including the ventromedially situated parvicellular group of cells) as the basolateral (BL) nucleus (Figs. 1, 3A,B,C). This classification is consistent with the atlas of the amygdala in Macaca fuscata according to the map of Kusama and Mabuchi ('70) and with the nomenclature used for the human amygdala according to Brockhaus ('40), Nitecka and Narkiewicz, ('76), andDe Olmos ('90). Our terminilogy for the cortical amygdaloid group requires some explanation as well. In the present account we recognize the existance of anterior (ACo) and posterior (PCo) sectors of the cortical nucleus as described by Price et al. ('87). Based on this recent parcelling of the cortical nucleus, Johnston's (23) cortical amydaloid nucleus, however, appears to lie medioventral to both ACo and PCo, and we thus use the name ventral cortical (VCo) to distinguish it from other subdivisions (fig. 1) The VCo does not seem to encompass the region variously designated the corticoamygdaloid transition area (Crosby and Humphrey, '41, '44; Lauer, '45), or the amygdalopiriform (APir) area (Humphrey, '68). However, the \"periamygdaloid cortex\" of some other authors (Rose, '27; Koikegami, '63; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87) includes both VCo and APir. We distinguish between these two regions because thymidine autoradiographic studies in the rat show developmental features consistent with those of a subcortical nuclear group formation for VCo Bayer, '80). In addition, maturation of APir seems to precede that of surrounding structures (Hilpert, '28; Brockhaus, '40; Humphrey, '68). We consider these facts to justify classificaton of APir as a separate anatomical entity distinct from VCo. Based on the above considerations, there are five groups of nuclei in the monkey amygdala: olfactory, medial, central, basal, and intrameduallary. On the basis of the hodological studies of Turner et al. ('78) describing the connectional relationship of the olfactory bulb and the amygdala in macaque monkeys, the olfactory amygdala consists of four nuclei [the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the anterior (ACo), ventral (VCo), and posterior (PCo) divisions of the cortical nuclei] and two areas [ the anterior amygdaloid (AAA) and the amygdalopiriform (APir)]. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is small and not easily delineated in monkeys. The VCo nucleus has three subdivisions, which we refer to as the superior (S), the intermediate (It), and the inferior (If). The medial group in the monkey includes the medial (Me) nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The central group consists only of the central (Ce) and the associated amygdaloid grisea. The basal group includes the basomedial (BM), basolateral (BL), and lateral (L) nuclei. Each of these three members of the basal group can be subdivided further into several subsectors (e.g., Amaral, '85; Price et al., Price et al., '87). The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei. The location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1. Because the cytoarchitecture and various aspects of the chemoarchitecture of the amygdala have been described in other studies (e.g., Lauer, '45; Jimenez-Castellanos, '49; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87;Amaral and Basset, '89), they will not be described here.\" (pp. 553, 555)",

('87) for the macaque monkey. In a comparative study Johnston ('23) subdivided the amygdala in the opossum, rat, rabbit, bat, macaque monkey, and in human embryos. Johnston's terminolgy for macaque monkey and human embryos is consistent with what he proposed for other nonprimate mammals, a procedure that was followed only partially by Crosby and Humphrey ('41) for the human amygdala, and later by Lauer ('45) in the macaque monkey. The major point of controversy concerns portions of the basal amygdaloid complex, which in the rat comprises the basomedial, basolateral, and lateral nuclei (De Olmos et al., '85; De Olmos, '90, for reviews). Johnston named the most dorsal and medial portion of the basal group the \"medial basal\" nucleus in primates. In an unexplained departure from Johnson's original account, Lauer ('45) used the name \"accessory basal\" for the same nucleus. Johnston ('23) reserved the name \"accessory basal\" for a different nucleus, which he claimed was present onlyin the oppossum among the species he had examined (see also Young, '36 for the rabbit, anfd Fox, '40 for the cat). Mehler's ('80) hodological studies in macaque monkeys led us to suggest that the accessory basal nucleus of primates described by Lauer ('45) would be at least in part homologous to the basomedial nucleus in the rat and cat, a possibilityt hat was also entertained by Price ('81) and Amaral ('85). Moreover, Price suggested that in the monkey the parvicellular portion of the adjacent \"basal\" nucleus (Bpc in his terminology) is homologous to the smaller-celled part of the basolateral nucleus in the rat and cat (see also Amaral,'85; Price et al., '87). Amaral ('85) suggested further that the entire \"basal\" nucleus in primates may be homologous with the basolateral nucleus in nonprimates. On the basis of the above considerations, and in agreement with previous discussions on this topic (Koikegami, '63; De Olmos, '90), it seems reasonable to retain the earlier terminology of Johnston ('23) with regard to the most medial and dorsal member of the basolateral group (basomedial, BM) and to consider the adjacent nucleus (including the ventromedially situated parvicellular group of cells) as the basolateral (BL) nucleus (Figs. 1, 3A,B,C). This classification is consistent with the atlas of the amygdala in Macaca fuscata according to the map of Kusama and Mabuchi ('70) and with the nomenclature used for the human amygdala according to Brockhaus ('40), Nitecka and Narkiewicz, ('76), andDe Olmos ('90). Our terminilogy for the cortical amygdaloid group requires some explanation as well. In the present account we recognize the existance of anterior (ACo) and posterior (PCo) sectors of the cortical nucleus as described by Price et al. ('87). Based on this recent parcelling of the cortical nucleus, Johnston's (23) cortical amydaloid nucleus, however, appears to lie medioventral to both ACo and PCo, and we thus use the name ventral cortical (VCo) to distinguish it from other subdivisions (fig. 1) The VCo does not seem to encompass the region variously designated the corticoamygdaloid transition area (Crosby and Humphrey, '41, '44; Lauer, '45), or the amygdalopiriform (APir) area (Humphrey, '68). However, the \"periamygdaloid cortex\" of some other authors (Rose, '27; Koikegami, '63; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87) includes both VCo and APir. We distinguish between these two regions because thymidine autoradiographic studies in the rat show developmental features consistent with those of a subcortical nuclear group formation for VCo Bayer, '80). In addition, maturation of APir seems to precede that of surrounding structures (Hilpert, '28; Brockhaus, '40; Humphrey, '68). We consider these facts to justify classificaton of APir as a separate anatomical entity distinct from VCo. Based on the above considerations, there are five groups of nuclei in the monkey amygdala: olfactory, medial, central, basal, and intrameduallary. On the basis of the hodological studies of Turner et al. ('78) describing the connectional relationship of the olfactory bulb and the amygdala in macaque monkeys, the olfactory amygdala consists of four nuclei [the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the anterior (ACo), ventral (VCo), and posterior (PCo) divisions of the cortical nuclei] and two areas [ the anterior amygdaloid (AAA) and the amygdalopiriform (APir)]. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is small and not easily delineated in monkeys. The VCo nucleus has three subdivisions, which we refer to as the superior (S), the intermediate (It), and the inferior (If). The medial group in the monkey includes the medial (Me) nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The central group consists only of the central (Ce) and the associated amygdaloid grisea. The basal group includes the basomedial (BM), basolateral (BL), and lateral (L) nuclei. Each of these three members of the basal group can be subdivided further into several subsectors (e.g., Amaral, '85; Price et al., Price et al., '87). The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei. The location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1. Because the cytoarchitecture and various aspects of the chemoarchitecture of the amygdala have been described in other studies (e.g., Lauer, '45; Jimenez-Castellanos, '49; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87;Amaral and Basset, '89), they will not be described here.\" (pp. 553, 555)",

On the basis of the hodological studies of Turner et al. ('78) describing the connectional relationship of the olfactory bulb and the amygdala in macaque monkeys, the olfactory amygdala consists of four nuclei [the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the anterior (ACo), ventral (VCo), and posterior (PCo) divisions of the cortical nuclei] and two areas [ the anterior amygdaloid (AAA) and the amygdalopiriform (APir)]. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is small and not easily delineated in monkeys. The VCo nucleus has three subdivisions, which we refer to as the superior (S), the intermediate (It), and the inferior (If). The medial group in the monkey includes the medial (Me) nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The central group consists only of the central (Ce) and the associated amygdaloid grisea. The basal group includes the basomedial (BM), basolateral (BL), and lateral (L) nuclei. Each of these three members of the basal group can be subdivided further into several subsectors (e.g., Amaral, '85; Price et al., Price et al., '87). The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei. The location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1. Because the cytoarchitecture and various aspects of the chemoarchitecture of the amygdala have been described in other studies (e.g., Lauer, '45; Jimenez-Castellanos, '49; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87;Amaral and Basset, '89), they will not be described here.\" (pp. 553, 555)",

('87) for the macaque monkey. In a comparative study Johnston ('23) subdivided the amygdala in the opossum, rat, rabbit, bat, macaque monkey, and in human embryos. Johnston's terminolgy for macaque monkey and human embryos is consistent with what he proposed for other nonprimate mammals, a procedure that was followed only partially by Crosby and Humphrey ('41) for the human amygdala, and later by Lauer ('45) in the macaque monkey. The major point of controversy concerns portions of the basal amygdaloid complex, which in the rat comprises the basomedial, basolateral, and lateral nuclei (De Olmos et al., '85; De Olmos, '90, for reviews). Johnston named the most dorsal and medial portion of the basal group the \"medial basal\" nucleus in primates. In an unexplained departure from Johnson's original account, Lauer ('45) used the name \"accessory basal\" for the same nucleus. Johnston ('23) reserved the name \"accessory basal\" for a different nucleus, which he claimed was present onlyin the oppossum among the species he had examined (see also Young, '36 for the rabbit, anfd Fox, '40 for the cat). Mehler's ('80) hodological studies in macaque monkeys led us to suggest that the accessory basal nucleus of primates described by Lauer ('45) would be at least in part homologous to the basomedial nucleus in the rat and cat, a possibilityt hat was also entertained by Price ('81) and Amaral ('85). Moreover, Price suggested that in the monkey the parvicellular portion of the adjacent \"basal\" nucleus (Bpc in his terminology) is homologous to the smaller-celled part of the basolateral nucleus in the rat and cat (see also Amaral,'85; Price et al., '87). Amaral ('85) suggested further that the entire \"basal\" nucleus in primates may be homologous with the basolateral nucleus in nonprimates. On the basis of the above considerations, and in agreement with previous discussions on this topic (Koikegami, '63; De Olmos, '90), it seems reasonable to retain the earlier terminology of Johnston ('23) with regard to the most medial and dorsal member of the basolateral group (basomedial, BM) and to consider the adjacent nucleus (including the ventromedially situated parvicellular group of cells) as the basolateral (BL) nucleus (Figs. 1, 3A,B,C). This classification is consistent with the atlas of the amygdala in Macaca fuscata according to the map of Kusama and Mabuchi ('70) and with the nomenclature used for the human amygdala according to Brockhaus ('40), Nitecka and Narkiewicz, ('76), andDe Olmos ('90). Our terminilogy for the cortical amygdaloid group requires some explanation as well. In the present account we recognize the existance of anterior (ACo) and posterior (PCo) sectors of the cortical nucleus as described by Price et al. ('87). Based on this recent parcelling of the cortical nucleus, Johnston's (23) cortical amydaloid nucleus, however, appears to lie medioventral to both ACo and PCo, and we thus use the name ventral cortical (VCo) to distinguish it from other subdivisions (fig. 1) The VCo does not seem to encompass the region variously designated the corticoamygdaloid transition area (Crosby and Humphrey, '41, '44; Lauer, '45), or the amygdalopiriform (APir) area (Humphrey, '68). However, the \"periamygdaloid cortex\" of some other authors (Rose, '27; Koikegami, '63; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87) includes both VCo and APir. We distinguish between these two regions because thymidine autoradiographic studies in the rat show developmental features consistent with those of a subcortical nuclear group formation for VCo Bayer, '80). In addition, maturation of APir seems to precede that of surrounding structures (Hilpert, '28; Brockhaus, '40; Humphrey, '68).

This classification is consistent with the atlas of the amygdala in Macaca fuscata according to the map of Kusama and Mabuchi ('70) and with the nomenclature used for the human amygdala according to Brockhaus ('40), Nitecka and Narkiewicz, ('76), andDe Olmos ('90). Our terminilogy for the cortical amygdaloid group requires some explanation as well. In the present account we recognize the existance of anterior (ACo) and posterior (PCo) sectors of the cortical nucleus as described by Price et al. ('87). Based on this recent parcelling of the cortical nucleus, Johnston's (23) cortical amydaloid nucleus, however, appears to lie medioventral to both ACo and PCo, and we thus use the name ventral cortical (VCo) to distinguish it from other subdivisions (fig. 1) The VCo does not seem to encompass the region variously designated the corticoamygdaloid transition area (Crosby and Humphrey, '41, '44; Lauer, '45), or the amygdalopiriform (APir) area (Humphrey, '68). However, the \"periamygdaloid cortex\" of some other authors (Rose, '27; Koikegami, '63; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87) includes both VCo and APir. We distinguish between these two regions because thymidine autoradiographic studies in the rat show developmental features consistent with those of a subcortical nuclear group formation for VCo Bayer, '80). In addition, maturation of APir seems to precede that of surrounding structures (Hilpert, '28; Brockhaus, '40; Humphrey, '68). We consider these facts to justify classificaton of APir as a separate anatomical entity distinct from VCo. Based on the above considerations, there are five groups of nuclei in the monkey amygdala: olfactory, medial, central, basal, and intrameduallary. On the basis of the hodological studies of Turner et al. ('78) describing the connectional relationship of the olfactory bulb and the amygdala in macaque monkeys, the olfactory amygdala consists of four nuclei [the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the anterior (ACo), ventral (VCo), and posterior (PCo) divisions of the cortical nuclei] and two areas [ the anterior amygdaloid (AAA) and the amygdalopiriform (APir)]. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is small and not easily delineated in monkeys. The VCo nucleus has three subdivisions, which we refer to as the superior (S), the intermediate (It), and the inferior (If). The medial group in the monkey includes the medial (Me) nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The central group consists only of the central (Ce) and the associated amygdaloid grisea. The basal group includes the basomedial (BM), basolateral (BL), and lateral (L) nuclei. Each of these three members of the basal group can be subdivided further into several subsectors (e.g., Amaral, '85; Price et al., Price et al., '87). The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei. The location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1. Because the cytoarchitecture and various aspects of the chemoarchitecture of the amygdala have been described in other studies (e.g., Lauer, '45; Jimenez-Castellanos, '49; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87;Amaral and Basset, '89), they will not be described here.\" (pp. 553, 555)",

Johnston's terminolgy for macaque monkey and human embryos is consistent with what he proposed for other nonprimate mammals, a procedure that was followed only partially by Crosby and Humphrey ('41) for the human amygdala, and later by Lauer ('45) in the macaque monkey. The major point of controversy concerns portions of the basal amygdaloid complex, which in the rat comprises the basomedial, basolateral, and lateral nuclei (De Olmos et al., '85; De Olmos, '90, for reviews). Johnston named the most dorsal and medial portion of the basal group the \"medial basal\" nucleus in primates. In an unexplained departure from Johnson's original account, Lauer ('45) used the name \"accessory basal\" for the same nucleus. Johnston ('23) reserved the name \"accessory basal\" for a different nucleus, which he claimed was present onlyin the oppossum among the species he had examined (see also Young, '36 for the rabbit, anfd Fox, '40 for the cat). Mehler's ('80) hodological studies in macaque monkeys led us to suggest that the accessory basal nucleus of primates described by Lauer ('45) would be at least in part homologous to the basomedial nucleus in the rat and cat, a possibilityt hat was also entertained by Price ('81) and Amaral ('85). Moreover, Price suggested that in the monkey the parvicellular portion of the adjacent \"basal\" nucleus (Bpc in his terminology) is homologous to the smaller-celled part of the basolateral nucleus in the rat and cat (see also Amaral,'85; Price et al., '87). Amaral ('85) suggested further that the entire \"basal\" nucleus in primates may be homologous with the basolateral nucleus in nonprimates. On the basis of the above considerations, and in agreement with previous discussions on this topic (Koikegami, '63; De Olmos, '90), it seems reasonable to retain the earlier terminology of Johnston ('23) with regard to the most medial and dorsal member of the basolateral group (basomedial, BM) and to consider the adjacent nucleus (including the ventromedially situated parvicellular group of cells) as the basolateral (BL) nucleus (Figs. 1, 3A,B,C). This classification is consistent with the atlas of the amygdala in Macaca fuscata according to the map of Kusama and Mabuchi ('70) and with the nomenclature used for the human amygdala according to Brockhaus ('40), Nitecka and Narkiewicz, ('76), andDe Olmos ('90). Our terminilogy for the cortical amygdaloid group requires some explanation as well. In the present account we recognize the existance of anterior (ACo) and posterior (PCo) sectors of the cortical nucleus as described by Price et al. ('87). Based on this recent parcelling of the cortical nucleus, Johnston's (23) cortical amydaloid nucleus, however, appears to lie medioventral to both ACo and PCo, and we thus use the name ventral cortical (VCo) to distinguish it from other subdivisions (fig. 1) The VCo does not seem to encompass the region variously designated the corticoamygdaloid transition area (Crosby and Humphrey, '41, '44; Lauer, '45), or the amygdalopiriform (APir) area (Humphrey, '68). However, the \"periamygdaloid cortex\" of some other authors (Rose, '27; Koikegami, '63; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87) includes both VCo and APir. We distinguish between these two regions because thymidine autoradiographic studies in the rat show developmental features consistent with those of a subcortical nuclear group formation for VCo Bayer, '80). In addition, maturation of APir seems to precede that of surrounding structures (Hilpert, '28; Brockhaus, '40; Humphrey, '68). We consider these facts to justify classificaton of APir as a separate anatomical entity distinct from VCo. Based on the above considerations, there are five groups of nuclei in the monkey amygdala: olfactory, medial, central, basal, and intrameduallary. On the basis of the hodological studies of Turner et al. ('78) describing the connectional relationship of the olfactory bulb and the amygdala in macaque monkeys, the olfactory amygdala consists of four nuclei [the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the anterior (ACo), ventral (VCo), and posterior (PCo) divisions of the cortical nuclei] and two areas [ the anterior amygdaloid (AAA) and the amygdalopiriform (APir)]. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is small and not easily delineated in monkeys. The VCo nucleus has three subdivisions, which we refer to as the superior (S), the intermediate (It), and the inferior (If). The medial group in the monkey includes the medial (Me) nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The central group consists only of the central (Ce) and the associated amygdaloid grisea. The basal group includes the basomedial (BM), basolateral (BL), and lateral (L) nuclei. Each of these three members of the basal group can be subdivided further into several subsectors (e.g., Amaral, '85; Price et al., Price et al., '87). The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei. The location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1. Because the cytoarchitecture and various aspects of the chemoarchitecture of the amygdala have been described in other studies (e.g., Lauer, '45; Jimenez-Castellanos, '49; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87;Amaral and Basset, '89), they will not be described here.\" (pp. 553, 555)",

The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei. The location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1. Because the cytoarchitecture and various aspects of the chemoarchitecture of the amygdala have been described in other studies (e.g., Lauer, '45; Jimenez-Castellanos, '49; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87;Amaral and Basset, '89), they will not be described here.\" (pp. 553, 555)",

('87) for the macaque monkey. In a comparative study Johnston ('23) subdivided the amygdala in the opossum, rat, rabbit, bat, macaque monkey, and in human embryos. Johnston's terminolgy for macaque monkey and human embryos is consistent with what he proposed for other nonprimate mammals, a procedure that was followed only partially by Crosby and Humphrey ('41) for the human amygdala, and later by Lauer ('45) in the macaque monkey. The major point of controversy concerns portions of the basal amygdaloid complex, which in the rat comprises the basomedial, basolateral, and lateral nuclei (De Olmos et al., '85; De Olmos, '90, for reviews). Johnston named the most dorsal and medial portion of the basal group the \"medial basal\" nucleus in primates. In an unexplained departure from Johnson's original account, Lauer ('45) used the name \"accessory basal\" for the same nucleus. Johnston ('23) reserved the name \"accessory basal\" for a different nucleus, which he claimed was present onlyin the oppossum among the species he had examined (see also Young, '36 for the rabbit, anfd Fox, '40 for the cat). Mehler's ('80) hodological studies in macaque monkeys led us to suggest that the accessory basal nucleus of primates described by Lauer ('45) would be at least in part homologous to the basomedial nucleus in the rat and cat, a possibilityt hat was also entertained by Price ('81) and Amaral ('85). Moreover, Price suggested that in the monkey the parvicellular portion of the adjacent \"basal\" nucleus (Bpc in his terminology) is homologous to the smaller-celled part of the basolateral nucleus in the rat and cat (see also Amaral,'85; Price et al., '87). Amaral ('85) suggested further that the entire \"basal\" nucleus in primates may be homologous with the basolateral nucleus in nonprimates. On the basis of the above considerations, and in agreement with previous discussions on this topic (Koikegami, '63; De Olmos, '90), it seems reasonable to retain the earlier terminology of Johnston ('23) with regard to the most medial and dorsal member of the basolateral group (basomedial, BM) and to consider the adjacent nucleus (including the ventromedially situated parvicellular group of cells) as the basolateral (BL) nucleus (Figs. 1, 3A,B,C). This classification is consistent with the atlas of the amygdala in Macaca fuscata according to the map of Kusama and Mabuchi ('70) and with the nomenclature used for the human amygdala according to Brockhaus ('40), Nitecka and Narkiewicz, ('76), andDe Olmos ('90). Our terminilogy for the cortical amygdaloid group requires some explanation as well. In the present account we recognize the existance of anterior (ACo) and posterior (PCo) sectors of the cortical nucleus as described by Price et al. ('87). Based on this recent parcelling of the cortical nucleus, Johnston's (23) cortical amydaloid nucleus, however, appears to lie medioventral to both ACo and PCo, and we thus use the name ventral cortical (VCo) to distinguish it from other subdivisions (fig. 1) The VCo does not seem to encompass the region variously designated the corticoamygdaloid transition area (Crosby and Humphrey, '41, '44; Lauer, '45), or the amygdalopiriform (APir) area (Humphrey, '68). However, the \"periamygdaloid cortex\" of some other authors (Rose, '27; Koikegami, '63; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87) includes both VCo and APir. We distinguish between these two regions because thymidine autoradiographic studies in the rat show developmental features consistent with those of a subcortical nuclear group formation for VCo Bayer, '80). In addition, maturation of APir seems to precede that of surrounding structures (Hilpert, '28; Brockhaus, '40; Humphrey, '68). We consider these facts to justify classificaton of APir as a separate anatomical entity distinct from VCo. Based on the above considerations, there are five groups of nuclei in the monkey amygdala: olfactory, medial, central, basal, and intrameduallary. On the basis of the hodological studies of Turner et al. ('78) describing the connectional relationship of the olfactory bulb and the amygdala in macaque monkeys, the olfactory amygdala consists of four nuclei [the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), the anterior (ACo), ventral (VCo), and posterior (PCo) divisions of the cortical nuclei] and two areas [ the anterior amygdaloid (AAA) and the amygdalopiriform (APir)]. The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract is small and not easily delineated in monkeys. The VCo nucleus has three subdivisions, which we refer to as the superior (S), the intermediate (It), and the inferior (If). The medial group in the monkey includes the medial (Me) nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The central group consists only of the central (Ce) and the associated amygdaloid grisea. The basal group includes the basomedial (BM), basolateral (BL), and lateral (L) nuclei. Each of these three members of the basal group can be subdivided further into several subsectors (e.g., Amaral, '85; Price et al., Price et al., '87). The fifth nuclear group of the amygdala comprises the intramedullary griseum. It is composed of small compact cell aggregates interposed between fiber bundles which form the medullary septa separating the different aygdaloid nuclei. The location of the various amygdaloid nuclei and their gross architecture is shown in photomicrographs of Nssl coronal sections through the amygdala in Figure 1. Because the cytoarchitecture and various aspects of the chemoarchitecture of the amygdala have been described in other studies (e.g., Lauer, '45; Jimenez-Castellanos, '49; Mikami, '52; Price et al., '87;Amaral and Basset, '89), they will not be described here.\" (pp. 553, 555)",

The basoventral included six basal (orbital) sites (areas PAll and Pro, cases 1 and 2; area 13, case 3b; O12, cases 3y and 5; and area 11, case 4), and three ventrolateral sites below, or in the lower bank of the principal sulcus within ventral area 46 (cases 6-8). In one of the two area 12 cases, an injection of diamidino yellow was located in the caudal portion of orbital area 12 (case 3y); in the other an HRP injection was in the rostral portion of orbital area 12 (case5).  In the three ventral area 46 cases, HRP injections were located in the lower portion of area 46 (case 6), in a region just below the principal sulcus (case 7), and within the lower bank of the central extent of the principal sulcs (cases8). The mediodorsal prefrontal regions included five medial sites (area 25, case 9; area 32, cases 10, 3r and 11y; and area 14, case 11b) and two dorsolateral sites within area 8 (cases 12 and 13). In one of the three cases with retrograde tracers in area 32, an HRP injection covered its rostro-ventral portion (case 10), in another a diamidino yellow injection was within the central portion of area 32 (case11y), and in a third a small injection  of fluorescent latex microspheres was within the caudal portion of area 32 (case 3r). In case 3r traces from the dye injection were noted in the deep layers (V and VI) in proisocortical area 25. In both area 8 cases the HRP injection was in the caudal part of dorsal area 8. In all cases in this study the needle tracts were restricted to the cortical mantle, and there was no apparent damage to the underlying white matter.\" (p. 555)",

In the three ventral area 46 cases, HRP injections were located in the lower portion of area 46 (case 6), in a region just below the principal sulcus (case 7), and within the lower bank of the central extent of the principal sulcs (case 8). The mediodorsal prefrontal regions included five medial sites (area 25, case 9; area 32, cases 10, 3r and 11y; and area 14, case 11b) and two dorsolateral sites within area 8 (cases 12 and 13). In one of the three cases with retrograde tracers in area 32, an HRP injection covered its rostro-ventral portion (case 10), in another a diamidino yellow injection was within the central portion of area 32 (case11y), and in a third a small injection  of fluorescent latex microspheres was within the caudal portion of area 32 (case 3r). In case 3r traces from the dye injection were noted in the deep layers (d VI) in proisocortical area 25. In both area 8 cases the HRP injection was in the caudal part of dorsal area 8. In all cases in this study the needle tracts were restricted to the cortical mantle, and there was no apparent damage to the underlying white matter.\" (p. 555)",

The basoventral included six basal (orbital) sites (areas PAll and Pro, cases 1 and 2; area 13, case 3b; O12, cases 3y and 5; and area 11, case 4), and three ventrolateral sites below, or in the lower bank of the principal sulcus within ventral area 46 (cases 6-8). In one of the two area 12 cases, an injection of diamidino yellow was located in the caudal portion of orbital area 12 (case 3y); in the other an HRP injection was in the rostral portion of orbital area 12 (case5).  In the three ventral area 46 cases, HRP injections were located in the lower portion of area 46 (case 6), in a region just below the principal sulcus (case 7), and within the lower bank of the central extent of the principal sulcs (cases8). The mediodorsal prefrontal regions included five medial sites (area 25, case 9; area 32, cases 10, 3r and 11y; and area 14, case 11b) and two dorsolateral sites within area 8 (cases 12 and 13). In one of the three cases with retrograde tracers in area 32, an HRP injection covered its rostro-ventral portion (case 10), in another a diamidino yellow injection was within the central portion of area 32 (case11y), and in a third a small injection  of fluorescent latex microspheres was within the caudal portion of area 32 (case 3r). In case 3r traces from the dye injection were noted in the deep layers (V and VI) in proisocortical area 25. In both area 8 cases the HRP injection was in the caudal part of dorsal area 8. In all cases in this study the needle tracts were restricted to the cortical mantle, and there was no apparent damage to the underlying white matter.\" (p. 555)",

The basoventral included six basal (orbital) sites (areas PAll and Pro, cases 1 and 2; area 13, case 3b; O12, cases 3y and 5; and area 11, case 4), and three ventrolateral sites below, or in the lower bank of the principal sulcus within ventral area 46 (cases 6-8). In one of the two area 12 cases, an injection of diamidino yellow was located in the caudal portion of orbital area 12 (case 3y); in the other an HRP injection was in the rostral portion of orbital area 12 (case5).  In the three ventral area 46 cases, HRP injections were located in the lower portion of area 46 (case 6), in a region just below the principal sulcus (case 7), and within the lower bank of the central extent of the principal sulcs (cases8). The mediodorsal prefrontal regions included five medial sites (area 25, case 9; area 32, cases 10, 3r and 11y; and area 14, case 11b) and two dorsolateral sites within area 8 (cases 12 and 13). In one of the three cases with retrograde tracers in area 32, an HRP injection covered its rostro-ventral portion (case 10), in another a diamidino yellow injection was within the central portion of area 32 (case11y), and in a third a small injection  of fluorescent latex microspheres was within the caudal portion of area 32 (case 3r). In case 3r traces from the dye injection were noted in the deep layers (V and VI) in proisocortical area 25. In both area 8 cases the HRP injection was in the caudal part of dorsal area 8. In all cases in this study the needle tracts were restricted to the cortical mantle, and there was no apparent damage to the underlying white matter.\" (p. 555)",

The basoventral included six basal (orbital) sites (areas PAll and Pro, cases 1 and 2; area 13, case 3b; O12, cases 3y and 5; and area 11, case 4), and three ventrolateral sites below, or in the lower bank of the principal sulcus within ventral area 46 (cases 6-8). In one of the two area 12 cases, an injection of diamidino yellow was located in the caudal portion of orbital area 12 (case 3y); in the other an HRP injection was in the rostral portion of orbital area 12 (case5).  In the three ventral area 46 cases, HRP injections were located in the lower portion of area 46 (case 6), in a region just below the principal sulcus (case 7), and within the lower bank of the central extent of the principal sulcs (cases8). The mediodorsal prefrontal regions included five medial sites (area 25, case 9; area 32, cases 10, 3r and 11y; and area 14, case 11b) and two dorsolateral sites within area 8 (cases 12 and 13).

    "title": "Projections from the amygdala to basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal regions in the rhesus monkey",
    "abstract": "The sources of ipsilateral projections from the amygdala to basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal cortices were studied with\r\nretrograde tracers (horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent dyes) in 13 rhesus monkeys. The basoventral regions injected with tracers\r\nincluded the orbital periallocortex and proisocortex, orbital areas 13, 11, and 12, lateral area 12, and ventral area 46. The mediodorsal\r\nregions included portions of medial areas 25, 32, 14, and dorsal area 8. The above sites represent areas within two architectonic series\r\nof cortices referred to as basoventral or mediodorsal on the basis of their anatomic location. Each series consists of areas that show a\r\ngradual increase in the number of layers and their delineation in a direction from the caudal orbital and medial limbic cortices, which\r\nhave an incipient laminar organization, towards the eulaminated periarcuate cortices (Barbas and Pandya, J. Comp. Neurol. 286:\r\n353-375, '89). Labeled neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex were found in the basolateral, basomedial (also known as accessory\r\nbasal), lateral, and ventral cortical nuclei, and in the anterior amygdaloid and amygdalopiriform areas. The distribution of labeled\r\nneurons differed both quantitatively and qualitatively depending on whether the injection sites were in basoventral or mediodorsal\r\nprefrontal cortices. Cases with caudal orbital injections had the most labeled neurons in the amygdala, followed by cases with injections\r\nin cortices situated medioventrally. The latter received a high proportion of their amygdaloid projections from the basomedial nucleus.\r\nThe lateral amygdaloid nucleus sent a robust projection to the least architectonically differentiated orbital periallocortex, and a weaker\r\nprojection to the adjoining orbital proisocortical regions, but did not appear to project to either medial proisocortical sites or to the more\r\ndifferentiated ventrolateral or dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. In addition, there were topographical differences in the origin of\r\nprojections from one amygdaloid nucleus directed to various prefrontal cortices. These differences were correlated either with the\r\ndestination of the axons of afferent amygdaloid neurons to basoventral or to mediodorsal prefrontal cortices and/or with their projection\r\nto areas with varying degrees of laminar organization within the basoventral or mediodorsal sector. The clearest topography was\r\nobserved for projections originating in the basolateral nucleus. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe results indicate that the least architectonically differentiated basal sites situated in the caudal orbitofrontal region, followed by the comparable medial areas situated ventrally on the medial surface, received the strongest and most widespraed projections from the amygdala. Medial proisocortices situated more dorsally and caudally received only a few projections from the amygdala. In addition, areas with a high degree of laminar organization (caudal areas 46 and 8) within both basoventral and mediodorsal regions received few and topographically  restricted amygdaloid projections.",
