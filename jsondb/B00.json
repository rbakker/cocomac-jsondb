  "Title": "Organization of connections of the basal and accessory basal nuclei in the monkey amygdala",
  "Abstract": "The present study investigated the intrinsic connections of the basal and accessory basal nuclei of the Macaca fascicularis monkey by means of the anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). Analysis of the intranuclear connections of the basal nucleus indicates that there are five modules: dorsal, intermediate, ventral lateral, ventral medial and periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. The dorsal division projects to the intermediate division. Laterally, the intermediate division projects to the ventral lateral division and dorsal parts of the ventral medial division. Ventrally, the ventral lateral division projects to the ventral medial division and periamygdaloid sulcal cortex, which appears to constitute a medial extension of the basal nucleus onto the cortical surface of the amygdala. Medially, the ventral medial division projects to the intermediate and dorsal divisions. Thus, the connections between these modules form functional microcolumns within the nucleus with distinct patterns of information flow that are dorsal to ventral laterally, lateral to medial ventrally, and ventral to dorsal medially. Observations on the intranuclear connections of the accessory basal nucleus suggest that they are organized into two relatively distinct domains: the dorsal division projects to the ventral division and the ventral division projects primarily to the ventromedial division. Projections to other amygdaloid areas originate in select divisions of the basal and accessory basal nuclei, and are topographically distributed. The organization of intrinsic connections of the basal nuclei correlates with specific amygdalo-cortical connections and suggests that extensive convergence of information takes place within the amygdala, which potentially influences activity at both the temporal and parietal pathways and hippocampal fields.",

      "Comments": "The basal amygdaloid nucleus of B00 (B00-B) has been divided into 5 subdivisions (Bd, Bi, Bvl, Bvm, BPACs) and that of PRA87 (PRA87-B) into 2 subdivisions (Bpc, Bmg). It is not unambiguously stated, if B00-Bi is a subpart of PRA87-Bmg and/or PRA87-Bpc. We can only assume that B00-Bi overlaps (RC-code=O) with PRA87-Bmg and (!)  Bpc, and that thus B00-Bd is a subpart of PRA87-Bmg and that B0087-Bvl/-vm are  both subparts of PRA87-Bpc. The reason for our assumption is (i) the approximate location of the corresponding subdivisions and (ii) the description of the cell sizes and enzyme distribution (B00, p. 1973: The dorsal magnocellular region has the largest cells and densest cholinergic innervation, and the intermediate and ventral parvicellular regions are characterized by progressively smaller cells and decreased cholinergic innervation [Price et al., 1987; Amaral et al., 1992]\"; PRA87, pp. 290-291: \"The basal nucleus [B] contains the largest cells in the amygdala and has the highest levels of AChE and ChAT. There is substantial variation in the size of neurons and the concentration of cholinergic markers in different parts of the nucleus, and it is generally divided into a dorsal, magnocellular part [Bmg] and a ventral, parvicellular [Bpc]. ...The dorsal or magnocellular portion of the basal nucleus has the largest cells in the amygdala and its neuropil stains intensely for AChE and ChAT. ...The parvicellular or smaller celled part of the basal nucleus is situated ventromedial to the magnocellular part in all ...It has a lower concentration of the cholinergic marker enzymes than the magnocellular part of the nucleus.\"; APPA92, p. 10: \"Price et al.

The intermediate division contains higher levels of the cholinergic markers than the parvicellular division but lowere levels than in the magnocellular division [Amaral and Bassett, 1989].\"). It should be also noted that B00-B contains the subdivision B00-BPACs, which is identical with PRA87-PACs and which is treated there as a subdivision of the PAC and not of the basal amygdaloid nucleus. Therefore, B00-B is larger than PRA87-B.",

The re-partition of the nucleus was based primarily on the present analysis of connections and on previously described cytoarchitectonic, histochemical and neurochemical characteristics. The dorsal magnocellular region has the largest cells and densest cholinergic innervation, and the intermediate and ventral parvicellular regions are characterized by progressively smaller cells and decreased cholinergic innervation Price et al., 1987; Amaral et al., 1992).

The accessory basal nucleus has been divided into dorsal, ventral and ventromedial divisions that closely correspond to the magnocellular, parvicellular and superficial or medial divisions described by Price et al. 1987). The basal paralaminar nucleus has been divided, based on the connectional data of the basal nucleus, into medial and lateral divisions according to the medial/lateral distinction of the ventral basal nucleus see also DeOlmos, 1990 for a similar distinction on the basis of cytoarchitectonic and histochemical characteristics).

      "Comments": "The periamygdaloid cortex (PAC) is divided by B00 into 4 subdivisions (PAC 1-3 and o) and by PA98 into 5 subdivisions (PAC 1-3, s, o). It should be noted that PAC of PA98 is larger than PAC of B00, because PACs of PA98 is identical with BPACs of B00 and thus a subdivision of the basal amygdaloid nucleus in B00 (B00-BPACs) and not of PAC as in PA98 (PA98-PACs) !",

      "Comments": "The periamygdaloid cortex (PAC) of B00 (PAC 1-3, o) and of PRA87 (PAC 1-3, s) consists of 4 subdivisions, but there are two important differences. First, PRA87 did not describe an area called PACs and second, BPACs of B00 is identical with PACs of PRA87, but PRA87-PACs is treated as a subdivision of the periamygdaloid cortex (PRA87-PAC), whereas B00-BPACs is treated as a subdivision of the basal amygdaloid nucleus (B00-B). It should also be noted, that PRA87 might recognized an area corresponding to PACo, but which he did not describe explicitly, because PRA87 only say:\" There are at least four subdivisions recognizable in the monkey. ...\" (p.

It should also be noted, that PRA87 might recognized an area corresponding to PACo, but which he did not describe explicitly, because PRA87 only say:\" There are at least four subdivisions recognizable in the monkey. ...\" (p.

It should also be noted, that PRA87 might recognized an area corresponding to PACo, but which he did not describe explicitly, because PRA87 only say:\" There are at least four subdivisions recognizable in the monkey. ...\" (p.

      "Comments": "The basal amygdaloid nucleus of B00 (B00-B) has been divided into 5 subdivisions (Bd, Bi, Bvl, Bvm, BPACs) and that of PRA87 (PRA87-B) into 2 subdivisions (Bpc, Bmg). It is not unambiguously stated, if B00-Bi is a subpart of PRA87-Bmg and/or PRA87-Bpc. We can only assume that B00-Bi overlaps (RC-code=O) with PRA87-Bmg and (!)  Bpc, and that thus B00-Bd is a subpart of PRA87-Bmg and that B0087-Bvl/-vm are  both subparts of PRA87-Bpc. The reason for our assumption is (i) the approximate location of the corresponding subdivisions and (ii) the description of the cell sizes and enzyme distribution (B00, p. 1973: The dorsal magnocellular region has the largest cells and densest cholinergic innervation, and the intermediate and ventral parvicellular regions are characterized by progressively smaller cells and decreased cholinergic innervation [Price et al., 1987; Amaral et al., 1992]\"; PRA87, pp. 290-291: \"The basal nucleus [B] contains the largest cells in the amygdala and has the highest levels of AChE and ChAT. There is substantial variation in the size of neurons and the concentration of cholinergic markers in different parts of the nucleus, and it is generally divided into a dorsal, magnocellular part [Bmg] and a ventral, parvicellular [Bpc]. ...The dorsal or magnocellular portion of the basal nucleus has the largest cells in the amygdala and its neuropil stains intensely for AChE and ChAT. ...The parvicellular or smaller celled part of the basal nucleus is situated ventromedial to the magnocellular part in all ...It has a lower concentration of the cholinergic marker enzymes than the magnocellular part of the nucleus.\"; APPA92, p. 10: \"Price et al. [1987] did not distinguish the intermediate division. The intermediate division contains higher levels of the cholinergic markers than the parvicellular division but lowere levels than in the magnocellular division [Amaral and Bassett, 1989].\"). It should be also noted that B00-B contains the subdivision B00-BPACs, which is identical with PRA87-PACs and which is treated there as a subdivision of the PAC and not of the basal amygdaloid nucleus. Therefore, B00-B is larger than PRA87-B.",

      "Comments": "The basal amygdaloid nucleus of B00 (B00-B) has been divided into 5 subdivisions (Bd, Bi, Bvl, Bvm, BPACs) and that of PRA87 (PRA87-B) into 2 subdivisions (Bpc, Bmg). It is not unambiguously stated, if B00-Bi is a subpart of PRA87-Bmg and/or PRA87-Bpc. We can only assume that B00-Bi overlaps (RC-code=O) with PRA87-Bmg and (!)  Bpc, and that thus B00-Bd is a subpart of PRA87-Bmg and that B0087-Bvl/-vm are  both subparts of PRA87-Bpc. The reason for our assumption is (i) the approximate location of the corresponding subdivisions and (ii) the description of the cell sizes and enzyme distribution (B00, p. 1973: The dorsal magnocellular region has the largest cells and densest cholinergic innervation, and the intermediate and ventral parvicellular regions are characterized by progressively smaller cells and decreased cholinergic innervation [Price et al., 1987; Amaral et al., 1992]\"; PRA87, pp. 290-291: \"The basal nucleus [B] contains the largest cells in the amygdala and has the highest levels of AChE and ChAT. There is substantial variation in the size of neurons and the concentration of cholinergic markers in different parts of the nucleus, and it is generally divided into a dorsal, magnocellular part [Bmg] and a ventral, parvicellular [Bpc]. ...The dorsal or magnocellular portion of the basal nucleus has the largest cells in the amygdala and its neuropil stains intensely for AChE and ChAT. ...The parvicellular or smaller celled part of the basal nucleus is situated ventromedial to the magnocellular part in all ...It has a lower concentration of the cholinergic marker enzymes than the magnocellular part of the nucleus.\"; APPA92, p. 10: \"Price et al. [1987] did not distinguish the intermediate division. The intermediate division contains higher levels of the cholinergic markers than the parvicellular division but lowere levels than in the magnocellular division [Amaral and Bassett, 1989].\"). It should be also noted that B00-B contains the subdivision B00-BPACs, which is identical with PRA87-PACs and which is treated there as a subdivision of the PAC and not of the basal amygdaloid nucleus. Therefore, B00-B is larger than PRA87-B.",

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of the intermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex.

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. Within the accessory basal nucleus, three injections involved the three subdivisions of the nucleus: dorsal division case  M4-98/BDA); ventral division case  M14-97/BDA, in which the injection was located close to the borders of the intermediate division of the basal nucleus); and ventromedial division  case M5-95/PHA-L).\" (1973-1975)",

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. Within the accessory basal nucleus, three injections involved the three subdivisions of the nucleus: dorsal division case  M4-98/BDA); ventral division case  M14-97/BDA, in which the injection was located close to the borders of the intermediate division of the basal nucleus); and ventromedial division  case M5-95/PHA-L).\" (1973-1975)",

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. Within the accessory basal nucleus, three injections involved the three subdivisions of the nucleus: dorsal division case  M4-98/BDA); ventral division case  M14-97/BDA, in which the injection was located close to the borders of the intermediate division of the basal nucleus); and ventromedial division  case M5-95/PHA-L).\" (1973-1975)",

Injection in the ventral medial division case M2-98/PHA-L), and not the ventral lateral division, did not project to the uncal subiculum but the projection was sharply circumscribed to the body of the subiculum, at the immediate border of the CA1 a region also termed the prosubiculum; see Saunders et al., 1988).

Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex.

The ventral lateral and ventral medial divisions projected to different levels of the subiculum. All injections in the ventral lateral division gave rise to a moderate projection to the uncal portion of the subiculum. Injection in the ventral medial division case M2-98/PHA-L), and not the ventral lateral division, did not project to the uncal subiculum but the projection was sharply circumscribed to the body of the subiculum, at the immediate border of the CA1 a region also termed the prosubiculum; see Saunders et al., 1988). The projection was extended caudally to the septal end of the hippocampus.\" (p. 1989)",

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. Within the accessory basal nucleus, three injections involved the three subdivisions of the nucleus: dorsal division case  M4-98/BDA); ventral division case  M14-97/BDA, in which the injection was located close to the borders of the intermediate division of the basal nucleus); and ventromedial division  case M5-95/PHA-L).\" (1973-1975)",

The labelled fibres were most dense rostrally, but they continued caudally in a position dorsal to the uncal portion of CA1. The dorsal division of the accessory basal nucleus was the only one of the regions investigated that give rise to a striking projection to the temporal two thirds of the CA1 field extending lightly to CA3 Fig. 13A and C). The labeling was heavy and primarily composed of short straight fibres resembling fibres en passage. Some of these fibres coursed through the amygdalohippocampal area to enter the hippocampus, but the evidence favours a direct projection from the dorsal division of the accessory basal nucleus to the CA1 field of the hippocampus.\" (p. 1989)",

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. Within the accessory basal nucleus, three injections involved the three subdivisions of the nucleus: dorsal division case  M4-98/BDA); ventral division case  M14-97/BDA, in which the injection was located close to the borders of the intermediate division of the basal nucleus); and ventromedial division  case M5-95/PHA-L).\" (1973-1975)",

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. Within the accessory basal nucleus, three injections involved the three subdivisions of the nucleus: dorsal division case  M4-98/BDA); ventral division case  M14-97/BDA, in which the injection was located close to the borders of the intermediate division of the basal nucleus); and ventromedial division  case M5-95/PHA-L).\" (1973-1975)",

The ventral lateral and ventral medial divisions projected to different levels of the subiculum. All injections in the ventral lateral division gave rise to a moderate projection to the uncal portion of the subiculum. Injection in the ventral medial division case M2-98/PHA-L), and not the ventral lateral division, did not project to the uncal subiculum but the projection was sharply circumscribed to the body of the subiculum, at the immediate border of the CA1 a region also termed the prosubiculum; see Saunders et al., 1988). The projection was extended caudally to the septal end of the hippocampus.\" (p. 1989)",

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. Within the accessory basal nucleus, three injections involved the three subdivisions of the nucleus: dorsal division case  M4-98/BDA); ventral division case  M14-97/BDA, in which the injection was located close to the borders of the intermediate division of the basal nucleus); and ventromedial division  case M5-95/PHA-L).\" (1973-1975)",

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. Within the accessory basal nucleus, three injections involved the three subdivisions of the nucleus: dorsal division case  M4-98/BDA); ventral division case  M14-97/BDA, in which the injection was located close to the borders of the intermediate division of the basal nucleus); and ventromedial division  case M5-95/PHA-L).\" (1973-1975)",

The labelled fibres were most dense rostrally, but they continued caudally in a position dorsal to the uncal portion of CA1. The dorsal division of the accessory basal nucleus was the only one of the regions investigated that give rise to a striking projection to the temporal two thirds of the CA1 field extending lightly to CA3 Fig. 13A and C). The labeling was heavy and primarily composed of short straight fibres resembling fibres en passage. Some of these fibres coursed through the amygdalohippocampal area to enter the hippocampus, but the evidence favours a direct projection from the dorsal division of the accessory basal nucleus to the CA1 field of the hippocampus.\" (p. 1989)",

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. Within the accessory basal nucleus, three injections involved the three subdivisions of the nucleus: dorsal division case  M4-98/BDA); ventral division case  M14-97/BDA, in which the injection was located close to the borders of the intermediate division of the basal nucleus); and ventromedial division  case M5-95/PHA-L).\" (1973-1975)",

The ventral lateral and ventral medial divisions projected to different levels of the subiculum. All injections in the ventral lateral division gave rise to a moderate projection to the uncal portion of the subiculum. Injection in the ventral medial division case M2-98/PHA-L), and not the ventral lateral division, did not project to the uncal subiculum but the projection was sharply circumscribed to the body of the subiculum, at the immediate border of the CA1 a region also termed the prosubiculum; see Saunders et al., 1988). The projection was extended caudally to the septal end of the hippocampus.\" (p. 1989)",

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. Within the accessory basal nucleus, three injections involved the three subdivisions of the nucleus: dorsal division case  M4-98/BDA); ventral division case  M14-97/BDA, in which the injection was located close to the borders of the intermediate division of the basal nucleus); and ventromedial division  case M5-95/PHA-L).\" (1973-1975)",

The labelled fibres were most dense rostrally, but they continued caudally in a position dorsal to the uncal portion of CA1. The dorsal division of the accessory basal nucleus was the only one of the regions investigated that give rise to a striking projection to the temporal two thirds of the CA1 field extending lightly to CA3 Fig. 13A and C). The labeling was heavy and primarily composed of short straight fibres resembling fibres en passage. Some of these fibres coursed through the amygdalohippocampal area to enter the hippocampus, but the evidence favours a direct projection from the dorsal division of the accessory basal nucleus to the CA1 field of the hippocampus.\" (p. 1989)",

The locations of each injection are summarized in Table 1 and schematically illustrated in coronal planes in Fig. 1. Within the basal nucleus, two injections involved mainly the dorsal division case  M6-97/BDA, in which cells labelled an intercalated nucleus situated to caudal parts of the accessory basal nucleus and case M12-98/PHA-L, in which a few cells were  located in the rostral intermediate division of the basal nucleus). Three injections were located in lateral parts of the intermediate division cases  M5-97/PHA-L; M7-98/BDA and M-1198/BDA). In case  M5-97/PHA-L, a significant amount of labelled neurons were located within the lateral. One injection case  M11-97/PHA-L) involved medial parts of th eintermediate division at the borders with the dorsal division. Two injections were located in the ventral medial division cases  M2-98/BDA and M6-98/PHA-L).\r\nFour injections were located in the ventral lateral division cases  M2-95/PHA-L, M4-97/BDA, M3-98/PHA-L, in which labelled cells were also located in the subjacent subiculum; and case  M13-98/PHA-L). Data were not obtained from the periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. Within the accessory basal nucleus, three injections involved the three subdivisions of the nucleus: dorsal division case  M4-98/BDA); ventral division case  M14-97/BDA, in which the injection was located close to the borders of the intermediate division of the basal nucleus); and ventromedial division  case M5-95/PHA-L).\" (1973-1975)",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the intrinsic connections of the basal and accessory basal nuclei of the Macaca fascicularis monkey by means of the anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). Analysis of the intranuclear connections of the basal nucleus indicates that there are five modules: dorsal, intermediate, ventral lateral, ventral medial and periamygdaloid sulcal cortex. The dorsal division projects to the intermediate division. Laterally, the intermediate division projects to the ventral lateral division and dorsal parts of the ventral medial division. Ventrally, the ventral lateral division projects to the ventral medial division and periamygdaloid sulcal cortex, which appears to constitute a medial extension of the basal nucleus onto the cortical surface of the amygdala. Medially, the ventral medial division projects to the intermediate and dorsal divisions. Thus, the connections between these modules form functional microcolumns within the nucleus with distinct patterns of information flow that are dorsal to ventral laterally, lateral to medial ventrally, and ventral to dorsal medially. Observations on the intranuclear connections of the accessory basal nucleus suggest that they are organized into two relatively distinct domains: the dorsal division projects to the ventral division and the ventral division projects primarily to the ventromedial division. Projections to other amygdaloid areas originate in select divisions of the basal and accessory basal nuclei, and are topographically distributed. The organization of intrinsic connections of the basal nuclei correlates with specific amygdalo-cortical connections and suggests that extensive convergence of information takes place within the amygdala, which potentially influences activity at both the temporal and parietal pathways and hippocampal fields.",
