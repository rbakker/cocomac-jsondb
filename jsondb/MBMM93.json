  "Title": "Effects on visual recognition of combined and seperate ablations of the entorhinal cortex in Rhesus monkeys",
  "Abstract": "\"Performance on visual delayed nonmatching-to-sample was assessed in rhesus monkeys with combined and separate ablations of the perirhinal and entorhinal cortex, as well as in unoperated controls. Combined (i.e., rhinal cortex) lesions\r\nyielded a striking impairment on this task, one almost as severe as that seen after combined amygdalohippocampal removals\r\nthat included some of this subjacent cortex (Mishkin, 1978; Murray and Mishkin, 1984). Ablations of the perirhinal cortex alone produced a deficit nearly as severe as that found after rhinal cortex lesions, whereas ablations of the entorhinal cortex\r\nalone produced only a mild deficit. Contrary to the conclusion from an earlier study (Murray and Mishkin, 1986), the present\r\nresults demonstrate not only that damage limited to the rhinal cortex is sufficient to produce a severe loss in visual recognition, but also that such damage leads to a far greater loss than damage to any other single structure in the medial part of the temporal lobe\"",
