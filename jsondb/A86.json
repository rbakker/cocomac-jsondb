  "Title": "A description of the amygdalo-hippocampal interconnections in the macaque monkey",
  "Abstract": "The interconnections between the amygdala and the hippocampal formation were investigated in the macaque monkey using anterograde tracers. The hippocampal inputs to the amygdala arose from the subicular and entorhinal cortices and passed through the angular bundle to terminate principally in the medial basal and lateral basal nuclei, with lighter termination in the lateral nucleus, the periamygdaloid cortex, and the cortical-transition area. The majority of these amygdaloid inputs arose from the rostral hippocampal formation although there was equivocal evidence of an additional projection from the caudal hippocampus to the central nucleus. Projections arose from many of the amygdaloid nuclei to terminate in the molecular layer of the amygdalo-hippocampal area and the adjacent stratum moleculare of the uncal portion of the hippocampus. The accessory basal, lateral basal, and medial basal nuclei also projected to the most rostral portions of the stratum moleculare of fields CA1-3, the heaviest termination occurring in field CA3. Additional projections from the basal nuclei terminated in the prosubiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. The heaviest entorhinal inputs arose from the accessory basal and lateral nuclei and terminated in layers I, II, and III of areas 28b, 28i, and the prorhinal cortex. The major amygdaloid input to the perirhinal cortex arose from the lateral basal nucleus.",

Light label was also present in the stratum moleculare of fields CA2 and CA1 in the rostral hippocampus.\r\nAn additional patch of terminal label was found throughout the rostro-caudal limit of the prosubiculum in those cases with injections centered in the medial basal (cases A10, A13) and the lateral basal (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei. Fibres from the perforant pathway terminated in a triangular region formed by the dorsolateral half the stratum pyramidale of the prosubiculum and the overlying stratum radiatum (Figs. 4, 5). This dorsolateral portion of the stratum pyramidale may be distinguished by its more densely packed and more regular pyramidal cells (Fig. 5). In some sections the label in this area extended into those CA1 pyramidal cells immediately adjacent to the prosubiculum. The lack of any comparable label in the cases with injections in amygdaloid nuclei other than the medial basal or lateral basal nuclei strongly indicates that it is these two nuclei which provide the prosubicular input. ...Although label diffused into the lateral basal (cases A10, A13) and medial basal (A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei there was no evidence of a specific input into area 28. This finding suggests that the dense label observed in cases A16, A17, and A20 did originate from the accessory basal and lateral nuclei. There was, however, evidence of an input from the lateral basal nucleus to layers I, II, and the superficial portion of III of the prorhinal cortex (cases A6, A-21-L, A21-R). This prorhinal label stopped caudally at the level of the genu of the hippocampus.\r\nWhile the terminal label in the prorhinal cortex tended to resemble that in area 28b in density and distribution, that in the perirhinal cortex often differed. The heaviest inputs to the perirhinal cortex appeared to arise from the lateral basal nucleus with dense label being concentrated in the superficial half of layer III, layer I, and possibly layer II (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R). Additional label was also present in these casees in layers V and VI, some of which reflected fibres of passage. Lighter projections, restricted to layer I of the perirhinal cortex,were observed following injections into the central (case A17) and lateral (case A16) nuclei, while the injections into the medial basal nucleus (A10, A13) resulted in light label in layers V and VI. No pertirhinal label was observed following injections centred in the medial nucleus (case A22) or the ventral, parvocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (cases A18, A20-L), although there was evidence of a light projection from the dorsal, magnocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (case A20-R) to the more rostral extent of layer III of the perirhinal cortex.\" (p. 521-523)",

Light label was also present in the stratum moleculare of fields CA2 and CA1 in the rostral hippocampus.\r\nAn additional patch of terminal label was found throughout the rostro-caudal limit of the prosubiculum in those cases with injections centered in the medial basal (cases A10, A13) and the lateral basal (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei. Fibres from the perforant pathway terminated in a triangular region formed by the dorsolateral half the stratum pyramidale of the prosubiculum and the overlying stratum radiatum (Figs. 4, 5). This dorsolateral portion of the stratum pyramidale may be distinguished by its more densely packed and more regular pyramidal cells (Fig. 5). In some sections the label in this area extended into those CA1 pyramidal cells immediately adjacent to the prosubiculum. The lack of any comparable label in the cases with injections in amygdaloid nuclei other than the medial basal or lateral basal nuclei strongly indicates that it is these two nuclei which provide the prosubicular input. ...Although label diffused into the lateral basal (cases A10, A13) and medial basal (A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei there was no evidence of a specific input into area 28. This finding suggests that the dense label observed in cases A16, A17, and A20 did originate from the accessory basal and lateral nuclei. There was, however, evidence of an input from the lateral basal nucleus to layers I, II, and the superficial portion of III of the prorhinal cortex (cases A6, A-21-L, A21-R). This prorhinal label stopped caudally at the level of the genu of the hippocampus.\r\nWhile the terminal label in the prorhinal cortex tended to resemble that in area 28b in density and distribution, that in the perirhinal cortex often differed. The heaviest inputs to the perirhinal cortex appeared to arise from the lateral basal nucleus with dense label being concentrated in the superficial half of layer III, layer I, and possibly layer II (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R). Additional label was also present in these casees in layers V and VI, some of which reflected fibres of passage. Lighter projections, restricted to layer I of the perirhinal cortex,were observed following injections into the central (case A17) and lateral (case A16) nuclei, while the injections into the medial basal nucleus (A10, A13) resulted in light label in layers V and VI. No pertirhinal label was observed following injections centred in the medial nucleus (case A22) or the ventral, parvocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (cases A18, A20-L), although there was evidence of a light projection from the dorsal, magnocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (case A20-R) to the more rostral extent of layer III of the perirhinal cortex.\" (p. 521-523)",

Following an injection centered in the medial nucleus (A22-L) the label in the stratum moleculare was restricted to the most medial portion of the hilar region. This case contained no other hippocampal label. …An even more restricted pattern of label was observed following an injection into the lateral nucleus (A16) with only light label being present in the stratum moleculare of the hilar region and the adjacent portion of field CA3. ...An additional patch of terminal label was found throughout the rostro-caudal limit of the prosubiculum in those cases with injections centered in the medial basal (cases A10, A13) and the lateral basal (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei. Fibres from the perforant pathway terminated in a triangular region formed by the dorsolateral half the stratum pyramidale of the prosubiculum and the overlying stratum radiatum (Figs. 4, 5). This dorsolateral portion of the stratum pyramidale may be distinguished by its more densely packed and more regular pyramidal cells (Fig. 5). In some sections the label in this area extended into those CA1 pyramidal cells immediately adjacent to the prosubiculum. The lack of any comparable label in the cases with injections in amygdaloid nuclei other than the medial basal or lateral basal nuclei strongly indicates that it is these two nuclei which provide the prosubicular input. ...Dense patterns of entorhinal label were observed following injections centred in either the lateral (A16) or accessory basal (A18, A20-L, A20-R) nuclei (Figs. 4, 6). This label was heaviest in the prorhinal cortex and area 28b, where it was concentrated in the deeper half of layer III. In area 28b the label extended ventrolaterally between the clumps or islands of cells in layer II to form 'fingers' which reached the deeper half of layer I. (Fig. 6). A similar, but more uniform, pattern of label was observed in layers I, II, and III of the prorhinal cortex with only occasional, faint 'fingers' of label being present in that part closest to area 28b. The label in area 28 continued into area 28i, where it was distributed more evenly throughout layer III (Fig. 6). In those cases with injections in the accessory basal nucleus this label continued medially into the most rostral portion of 28a, stopping abruptly at the genu of the hippocampus. It was noted that of the injection in the accessory basal nucles those involving the parvocellular division produced the heaviest label within area 28 (cases A18, A20-L).\" (pp. 521-522)\r\n\"While the terminal label in the prorhinal cortex tended to resemble that in area 28b in density and distribution, that in the perirhinal cortex often differed. The heaviest inputs to the perirhinal cortex appeared to arise from the lateral basal nucleus with dense label being concentrated in the superficial half of layer III, layer I, and possibly layer II (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R). Additional label was also present in these casees in layers V and VI, some of which reflected fibres of passage. Lighter projections, restricted to layer I of the perirhinal cortex,were observed following injections into the central (case A17) and lateral (case A16) nuclei, while the injections into the medial basal nucleus (A10, A13) resulted in light label in layers V and VI. No pertirhinal label was observed following injections centred in the medial nucleus (case A22) or the ventral, parvocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (cases A18, A20-L), although there was evidence of a light projection from the dorsal, magnocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (case A20-R) to the more rostral extent of layer III of the perirhinal cortex.\" (p. 523)",

This label was found throughout the stratum moleculare of the hilar region although it was often most dense close to its lateral border (Figs. 4, 5). A similar, but lighter pattern pf label was observed in those cases with injections in the lateral (A16) and medial basal (A10, A13) nuclei. Following an injection centered in the medial nucleus (A22-L) the label in the stratum moleculare was restricted to the most medial portion of the hilar region. This case contained no other hippocampal label. …A very similar pattern of hippocampal label was observed when the injection involved the central nucleus and the most dorsal portion of the lateral basal nucleus (case A17). The only difference was that the label did not extend to the rostral tip of the genu. ...An additional patch of terminal label was found throughout the rostro-caudal limit of the prosubiculum in those cases with injections centered in the medial basal (cases A10, A13) and the lateral basal (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei. Fibres from the perforant pathway terminated in a triangular region formed by the dorsolateral half the stratum pyramidale of the prosubiculum and the overlying stratum radiatum (Figs. 4, 5). This dorsolateral portion of the stratum pyramidale may be distinguished by its more densely packed and more regular pyramidal cells (Fig. 5). In some sections the label in this area extended into those CA1 pyramidal cells immediately adjacent to the prosubiculum. The lack of any comparable label in the cases with injections in amygdaloid nuclei other than the medial basal or lateral basal nuclei strongly indicates that it is these two nuclei which provide the prosubicular input. ...Much more restricted patterns of entorhinal label were observed in the other cases. Following an injection centred in the central nucleus (A17) label was limited to the deeper half of layer I in areas 28b, 28i, and the prorhinal cortex. This label decreased at the caudal level of the amygdala and disappeared close to the level of the genu. The only additional label was present in the superficial half of layer III of the prorhinal cortex. Terminal label was also found in layer I when an injection was placed in the medial nucleus (A22) although it was restricted to that part of area 28b adjacent to the cortical transition area.\" (pp. 521-522)\r\n\"While the terminal label in the prorhinal cortex tended to resemble that in area 28b in density and distribution, that in the perirhinal cortex often differed. The heaviest inputs to the perirhinal cortex appeared to arise from the lateral basal nucleus with dense label being concentrated in the superficial half of layer III, layer I, and possibly layer II (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R). Additional label was also present in these casees in layers V and VI, some of which reflected fibres of passage. Lighter projections, restricted to layer I of the perirhinal cortex,were observed following injections into the central (case A17) and lateral (case A16) nuclei, while the injections into the medial basal nucleus (A10, A13) resulted in light label in layers V and VI. No pertirhinal label was observed following injections centred in the medial nucleus (case A22) or the ventral, parvocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (cases A18, A20-L), although there was evidence of a light projection from the dorsal, magnocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (case A20-R) to the more rostral extent of layer III of the perirhinal cortex.\" (p. 523)",

The label in CA3 persisted to almost the caudal limit of the uncus while that in CA1, although faint, continued for 2.3 mm beyond the uncus. ...An additional patch of terminal label was found throughout the rostro-caudal limit of the prosubiculum in those cases with injections centered in the medial basal (cases A10, A13) and the lateral basal (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei. Fibres from the perforant pathway terminated in a triangular region formed by the dorsolateral half the stratum pyramidale of the prosubiculum and the overlying stratum radiatum (Figs. 4, 5). This dorsolateral portion of the stratum pyramidale may be distinguished by its more densely packed and more regular pyramidal cells (Fig. 5). In some sections the label in this area extended into those CA1 pyramidal cells immediately adjacent to the prosubiculum. The lack of any comparable label in the cases with injections in amygdaloid nuclei other than the medial basal or lateral basal nuclei strongly indicates that it is these two nuclei which provide the prosubicular input.\r\nDense patterns of entorhinal label were observed following injections centred in either the lateral (A16) or accessory basal (A18, A20-L, A20-R) nuclei (Figs. 4, 6). This label was heaviest in the prorhinal cortex and area 28b, where it was concentrated in the deeper half of layer III. In area 28b the label extended ventrolaterally between the clumps or islands of cells in layer II to form 'fingers' which reached the deeper half of layer I. (Fig. 6). A similar, but more uniform, pattern of label was observed in layers I, II, and III of the prorhinal cortex with only occasional, faint 'fingers' of label being present in that part closest to area 28b. The label in area 28 continued into area 28i, where it was distributed more evenly throughout layer III (Fig. 6). In those cases with injections in the accessory basal nucleus this label continued medially into the most rostral portion of 28a, stopping abruptly at the genu of the hippocampus. It was noted that of the injection in the accessory basal nucles those involving the parvocellular division produced the heaviest label within area 28 (cases A18, A20-L).\" (p. 521-522)\r\n\"While the terminal label in the prorhinal cortex tended to resemble that in area 28b in density and distribution, that in the perirhinal cortex often differed. The heaviest inputs to the perirhinal cortex appeared to arise from the lateral basal nucleus with dense label being concentrated in the superficial half of layer III, layer I, and possibly layer II (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R). Additional label was also present in these casees in layers V and VI, some of which reflected fibres of passage. Lighter projections, restricted to layer I of the perirhinal cortex,were observed following injections into the central (case A17) and lateral (case A16) nuclei, while the injections into the medial basal nucleus (A10, A13) resulted in light label in layers V and VI. No pertirhinal label was observed following injections centred in the medial nucleus (case A22) or the ventral, parvocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (cases A18, A20-L), although there was evidence of a light projection from the dorsal, magnocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (case A20-R) to the more rostral extent of layer III of the perirhinal cortex.\" (p. 523)",

The label in CA3 persisted to almost the caudal limit of the uncus while that in CA1, although faint, continued for 2.3 mm beyond the uncus. ...An additional patch of terminal label was found throughout the rostro-caudal limit of the prosubiculum in those cases with injections centered in the medial basal (cases A10, A13) and the lateral basal (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei. Fibres from the perforant pathway terminated in a triangular region formed by the dorsolateral half the stratum pyramidale of the prosubiculum and the overlying stratum radiatum (Figs. 4, 5). This dorsolateral portion of the stratum pyramidale may be distinguished by its more densely packed and more regular pyramidal cells (Fig. 5). In some sections the label in this area extended into those CA1 pyramidal cells immediately adjacent to the prosubiculum. The lack of any comparable label in the cases with injections in amygdaloid nuclei other than the medial basal or lateral basal nuclei strongly indicates that it is these two nuclei which provide the prosubicular input. ...Dense patterns of entorhinal label were observed following injections centred in either the lateral (A16) or accessory basal (A18, A20-L, A20-R) nuclei (Figs. 4, 6). This label was heaviest in the prorhinal cortex and area 28b, where it was concentrated in the deeper half of layer III. In area 28b the label extended ventrolaterally between the clumps or islands of cells in layer II to form 'fingers' which reached the deeper half of layer I. (Fig. 6). A similar, but more uniform, pattern of label was observed in layers I, II, and III of the prorhinal cortex with only occasional, faint 'fingers' of label being present in that part closest to area 28b. The label in area 28 continued into area 28i, where it was distributed more evenly throughout layer III (Fig. 6). In those cases with injections in the accessory basal nucleus this label continued medially into the most rostral portion of 28a, stopping abruptly at the genu of the hippocampus. It was noted that of the injection in the accessory basal nucles those involving the parvocellular division produced the heaviest label within area 28 (cases A18, A20-L).\" (pp. 521-522)\r\n\"While the terminal label in the prorhinal cortex tended to resemble that in area 28b in density and distribution, that in the perirhinal cortex often differed. The heaviest inputs to the perirhinal cortex appeared to arise from the lateral basal nucleus with dense label being concentrated in the superficial half of layer III, layer I, and possibly layer II (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R). Additional label was also present in these casees in layers V and VI, some of which reflected fibres of passage. Lighter projections, restricted to layer I of the perirhinal cortex,were observed following injections into the central (case A17) and lateral (case A16) nuclei, while the injections into the medial basal nucleus (A10, A13) resulted in light label in layers V and VI. No pertirhinal label was observed following injections centred in the medial nucleus (case A22) or the ventral, parvocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (cases A18, A20-L), although there was evidence of a light projection from the dorsal, magnocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (case A20-R) to the more rostral extent of layer III of the perirhinal cortex.\" (p. 523)",

No pertirhinal label was observed following injections centred in the medial nucleus (case A22) or the ventral, parvocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (cases A18, A20-L), although there was evidence of a light projection from the dorsal, magnocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (case A20-R) to the more rostral extent of layer III of the perirhinal cortex.\" (p. 523)",

The label in CA3 persisted to almost the caudal limit of the uncus while that in CA1, although faint, continued for 2.3 mm beyond the uncus. ...An additional patch of terminal label was found throughout the rostro-caudal limit of the prosubiculum in those cases with injections centered in the medial basal (cases A10, A13) and the lateral basal (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei. Fibres from the perforant pathway terminated in a triangular region formed by the dorsolateral half the stratum pyramidale of the prosubiculum and the overlying stratum radiatum (Figs. 4, 5). This dorsolateral portion of the stratum pyramidale may be distinguished by its more densely packed and more regular pyramidal cells (Fig. 5). In some sections the label in this area extended into those CA1 pyramidal cells immediately adjacent to the prosubiculum. The lack of any comparable label in the cases with injections in amygdaloid nuclei other than the medial basal or lateral basal nuclei strongly indicates that it is these two nuclei which provide the prosubicular input.\r\nEvidence of light projections to the presubiculum and parasubiculum was found in two cases with injections in the lateral basal nucleus (A21-L, A21-R). The presubicular label was centred over the closely-packed spherical cells, which comprise lamina II, and the immediately adjacent parts of the molecular layer (Fig. 4). This label was largely restricted to the border of the presubiculum with the subiculum, although in case A21-L light label extended into the ventral half of lamina II of the rostral presubiculum. Labeled fibers and termination were also observed in the deeper half of lamina I of the rostral parasubiculum. While this projection disappeared at the caudal limit of the rhinal sulcus, the input to the presubiculum extended throughout the length of the hippocampus although it became lighter in the caudal hippocampus. ...Although label diffused into the lateral basal (cases A10, A13) and medial basal (A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei there was no evidence of a specific input into area 28. This finding suggests that the dense label observed in cases A16, A17, and A20 did originate from the accessory basal and lateral nuclei. There was, however, evidence of an input from the lateral basal nucleus to layers I, II, and the superficial portion of III of the prorhinal cortex (cases A6, A-21-L, A21-R). This prorhinal label stopped caudally at the level of the genu of the hippocampus.\r\nWhile the terminal label in the prorhinal cortex tended to resemble that in area 28b in density and distribution, that in the perirhinal cortex often differed. The heaviest inputs to the perirhinal cortex appeared to arise from the lateral basal nucleus with dense label being concentrated in the superficial half of layer III, layer I, and possibly layer II (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R). Additional label was also present in these casees in layers V and VI, some of which reflected fibres of passage. Lighter projections, restricted to layer I of the perirhinal cortex,were observed following injections into the central (case A17) and lateral (case A16) nuclei, while the injections into the medial basal nucleus (A10, A13) resulted in light label in layers V and VI. No pertirhinal label was observed following injections centred in the medial nucleus (case A22) or the ventral, parvocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (cases A18, A20-L), although there was evidence of a light projection from the dorsal, magnocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (case A20-R) to the more rostral extent of layer III of the perirhinal cortex.\" (p. 521-523)",

Following an injection centered in the medial nucleus (A22-L) the label in the stratum moleculare was restricted to the most medial portion of the hilar region.

While most of this label derived from fibers passing through AHA there was evidence that some fibers might enter the hippocampus directly from the medial basal nucleus. The label in the genu extended laterally from the uncal region to form a continuous crescent linking the stratum moleculare of fields CA3, CA2, and CA1 (Fig. 4). The terminal label stopped, however, at the subiculum where only labeled fibers could be seen in the molecular layer.

The label in CA3 persisted to almost the caudal limit of the uncus while that in CA1, although faint, continued for 2.3 mm beyond the uncus. ...An additional patch of terminal label was found throughout the rostro-caudal limit of the prosubiculum in those cases with injections centered in the medial basal (cases A10, A13) and the lateral basal (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei. Fibres from the perforant pathway terminated in a triangular region formed by the dorsolateral half the stratum pyramidale of the prosubiculum and the overlying stratum radiatum (Figs. 4, 5). This dorsolateral portion of the stratum pyramidale may be distinguished by its more densely packed and more regular pyramidal cells (Fig. 5). In some sections the label in this area extended into those CA1 pyramidal cells immediately adjacent to the prosubiculum. The lack of any comparable label in the cases with injections in amygdaloid nuclei other than the medial basal or lateral basal nuclei strongly indicates that it is these two nuclei which provide the prosubicular input.\r\nEvidence of light projections to the presubiculum and parasubiculum was found in two cases with injections in the lateral basal nucleus (A21-L, A21-R). The presubicular label was centred over the closely-packed spherical cells, which comprise lamina II, and the immediately adjacent parts of the molecular layer (Fig. 4). This label was largely restricted to the border of the presubiculum with the subiculum, although in case A21-L light label extended into the ventral half of lamina II of the rostral presubiculum. Labeled fibers and termination were also observed in the deeper half of lamina I of the rostral parasubiculum. While this projection disappeared at the caudal limit of the rhinal sulcus, the input to the presubiculum extended throughout the length of the hippocampus although it became lighter in the caudal hippocampus. ...Although label diffused into the lateral basal (cases A10, A13) and medial basal (A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei there was no evidence of a specific input into area 28. This finding suggests that the dense label observed in cases A16, A17, and A20 did originate from the accessory basal and lateral nuclei. There was, however, evidence of an input from the lateral basal nucleus to layers I, II, and the superficial portion of III of the prorhinal cortex (cases A6, A-21-L, A21-R). This prorhinal label stopped caudally at the level of the genu of the hippocampus.\r\nWhile the terminal label in the prorhinal cortex tended to resemble that in area 28b in density and distribution, that in the perirhinal cortex often differed. The heaviest inputs to the perirhinal cortex appeared to arise from the lateral basal nucleus with dense label being concentrated in the superficial half of layer III, layer I, and possibly layer II (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R). Additional label was also present in these casees in layers V and VI, some of which reflected fibres of passage. Lighter projections, restricted to layer I of the perirhinal cortex,were observed following injections into the central (case A17) and lateral (case A16) nuclei, while the injections into the medial basal nucleus (A10, A13) resulted in light label in layers V and VI. No pertirhinal label was observed following injections centred in the medial nucleus (case A22) or the ventral, parvocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (cases A18, A20-L), although there was evidence of a light projection from the dorsal, magnocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (case A20-R) to the more rostral extent of layer III of the perirhinal cortex.\" (p. 521-523)",

While most of this label derived from fibers passing through AHA there was evidence that some fibers might enter the hippocampus directly from the medial basal nucleus. The label in the genu extended laterally from the uncal region to form a continuous crescent linking the stratum moleculare of fields CA3, CA2, and CA1 (Fig. 4). The terminal label stopped, however, at the subiculum where only labeled fibers could be seen in the molecular layer. This crescent of hippocampal label, which was present in the most rostral 2-3 mm of the genu of the hippocampus, was heaviest in the hilar region and that part of field CA3 adjacent to the hilar region, and lightest in fields CA1 and CA2 (Fig. 6). In field CA3 the label was distributed throughout the depth of the stratum moleculare while in field CA1 this label was concentrated in the basal half of the stratum. The label in CA3 persisted to almost the caudal limit of the uncus while that in CA1, although faint, continued for 2.3 mm beyond the uncus.\" (p. 521)",

In some sections the label in this area extended into those CA1 pyramidal cells immediately adjacent to the prosubiculum. The lack of any comparable label in the cases with injections in amygdaloid nuclei other than the medial basal or lateral basal nuclei strongly indicates that it is these two nuclei which provide the prosubicular input. ...Although label diffused into the lateral basal (cases A10, A13) and medial basal (A6, A21-L, A21-R) nuclei there was no evidence of a specific input into area 28. This finding suggests that the dense label observed in cases A16, A17, and A20 did originate from the accessory basal and lateral nuclei. There was, however, evidence of an input from the lateral basal nucleus to layers I, II, and the superficial portion of III of the prorhinal cortex (cases A6, A-21-L, A21-R). This prorhinal label stopped caudally at the level of the genu of the hippocampus.\r\nWhile the terminal label in the prorhinal cortex tended to resemble that in area 28b in density and distribution, that in the perirhinal cortex often differed. The heaviest inputs to the perirhinal cortex appeared to arise from the lateral basal nucleus with dense label being concentrated in the superficial half of layer III, layer I, and possibly layer II (cases A6, A21-L, A21-R). Additional label was also present in these casees in layers V and VI, some of which reflected fibres of passage. Lighter projections, restricted to layer I of the perirhinal cortex,were observed following injections into the central (case A17) and lateral (case A16) nuclei, while the injections into the medial basal nucleus (A10, A13) resulted in light label in layers V and VI. No pertirhinal label was observed following injections centred in the medial nucleus (case A22) or the ventral, parvocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (cases A18, A20-L), although there was evidence of a light projection from the dorsal, magnocellular portion of the accessory basal nucleus (case A20-R) to the more rostral extent of layer III of the perirhinal cortex.\" (p. 521-523)",

    "abstract": "The interconnections between the amygdala and the hippocampal formation were investigated in the macaque monkey using anterograde tracers. The hippocampal inputs to the amygdala arose from the subicular and entorhinal cortices and passed through the angular bundle to terminate principally in the medial basal and lateral basal nuclei, with lighter termination in the lateral nucleus, the periamygdaloid cortex, and the cortical-transition area. The majority of these amygdaloid inputs arose from the rostral hippocampal formation although there was equivocal evidence of an additional projection from the caudal hippocampus to the central nucleus. Projections arose from many of the amygdaloid nuclei to terminate in the molecular layer of the amygdalo-hippocampal area and the adjacent stratum moleculare of the uncal portion of the hippocampus. The accessory basal, lateral basal, and medial basal nuclei also projected to the most rostral portions of the stratum moleculare of fields CA1-3, the heaviest termination occurring in field CA3. Additional projections from the basal nuclei terminated in the prosubiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. The heaviest entorhinal inputs arose from the accessory basal and lateral nuclei and terminated in layers I, II, and III of areas 28b, 28i, and the prorhinal cortex. The major amygdaloid input to the perirhinal cortex arose from the lateral basal nucleus.",
