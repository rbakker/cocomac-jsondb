  "Title": "Organization of the intrinsic connections of the monkey amygdaloid complex: Projections originating in the lateral nucleus",
  "Abstract": "We have used the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) to study the intrinsic projections of the lateral nucleus of the Macaca fascicularis monkey amygdaloid complex. A reanalysis of the monkey lateral nucleus indicated that there are at least four distinct cytoarchitectonic divisions: dorsal, dorsal intermediate, ventral intermediate, and ventral. The major projections within the lateral nucleus originate in the dorsal, dorsal intermediate, and ventral intermediate divisions and terminate in the ventral division. The ventral division also projects to itself but does not project significantly to the other divisions of the lateral nucleus. Thus, the ventral division appears to be a site of convergence for information entering all other portions of the lateral nucleus. There are substantial regional and topographic differences in the projections from each of the lateral nucleus divisions to other amygdaloid nuclei. The dorsal division projects to all divisions of the basal and accessory basal nuclei, to the periamygdaloid cortex, the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, the dorsal division of the amygdalohippocampal area, and the lateral capsular nuclei. The dorsal intermediate division projects to the intermediate and parvicellular divisions of the basal nucleus, to the parvicellular division of the accessory basal nucleus, and to the periamygdaloid cortex. The ventral intermediate division projects to the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus and to the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus. The major projections from the ventral division are directed to the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus, the parvicellular division of the accessory basal nucleus, the medial nucleus, and the periamygdaloid cortex. Projections from all portions of the lateral nucleus to the central nucleus are generally very light. It appears, therefore, that each division of the lateral nucleus originates topographically organized projections to the other amygdaloid areas that terminate in distinct portions of the target regions. The topographic organization of intrinsic amygdaloid projections raises the possibility that serial and parallel sensory processing may take place within the amygdaloid complex.",

APPC82 says on page p. 13 that both subdivisions are not identical. Areas ABmc and ABpc of both authors have indeed the same name and approximately (!) the same location, but it should be kept in mind that, although it has been said that PA98 adopted the descriptions of PRA87, both area do not necessarily have the same extension and borders.",

APPC82 says on page p. 13 that both subdivisions are not identical. Areas ABmc and ABpc of both authors have indeed the same name and approximately (!) the same location, but it should be kept in mind that, although it has been said that PA98 adopted the descriptions of PRA87, both areas do not necessarily have the same extension and borders.",

APPC82 says on page p. 13 that both subdivisions are not identical. Areas ABmc and ABpc of both authors have indeed the same name and approximately (!) the same location, but it should be kept in mind that, although it has been said that PA98 adopted the descriptions of PRA87, both area do not necessarily have the same extension and borders.",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91).

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

In two cases, the injection involved mainly the dorsal division (cases M7-91 and M10-90; a few cells were also labeled in the intermediate division of the basal nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the rostral paralaminar nucleus). Six injections were located in the dorsal intermediate division (cases M9-90; M8-89; M8-89; M2-90; in which a few labeled cells were also located in the ventromedial putamen; and M20-89). In case M11-91, labeled neurons were located within the lateral nucleus but were uncharacteristically distributed for nearly 4-5 mm dorsoventrally along the pipette tract. Most fo the labeled cells, however, were located in the dorsal and dorsal intermediate divisions. Three injections were located in the ventral intermediate division (cases M13-91, M15-91, and M1-91), anf five were in the ventral division (case M3-90, in which a few cells were located in the paralaminar nucleus ventrally adjacent to the lateral nucleus; and cases M6-90, M11-88, M5-91, and M6-91). Taken together, the injetions involved all divisions of the lateral nucleus and essentially all rostrocaudal levels of the nucleus.\" (p. 437)",

    "abstract": "We have used the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) to study the intrinsic projections of the lateral nucleus of the Macaca fascicularis monkey amygdaloid complex. A reanalysis of the monkey lateral nucleus indicated that there are at least four distinct cytoarchitectonic divisions: dorsal, dorsal intermediate, ventral intermediate, and ventral. The major projections within the lateral nucleus originate in the dorsal, dorsal intermediate, and ventral intermediate divisions and terminate in the ventral division. The ventral division also projects to itself but does not project significantly to the other divisions of the lateral nucleus. Thus, the ventral division appears to be a site of convergence for information entering all other portions of the lateral nucleus. There are substantial regional and topographic differences in the projections from each of the lateral nucleus divisions to other amygdaloid nuclei. The dorsal division projects to all divisions of the basal and accessory basal nuclei, to the periamygdaloid cortex, the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, the dorsal division of the amygdalohippocampal area, and the lateral capsular nuclei. The dorsal intermediate division projects to the intermediate and parvicellular divisions of the basal nucleus, to the parvicellular division of the accessory basal nucleus, and to the periamygdaloid cortex. The ventral intermediate division projects to the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus and to the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus. The major projections from the ventral division are directed to the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus, the parvicellular division of the accessory basal nucleus, the medial nucleus, and the periamygdaloid cortex. Projections from all portions of the lateral nucleus to the central nucleus are generally very light. It appears, therefore, that each division of the lateral nucleus originates topographically organized projections to the other amygdaloid areas that terminate in distinct portions of the target regions. The topographic organization of intrinsic amygdaloid projections raises the possibility that serial and parallel sensory processing may take place within the amygdaloid complex.",
