  "Title": "A description of intra-amygdaloid connections in old world monkeys",
  "Abstract": "The intrinsic amygdaloid connections of the cynomolgus monkey were investigated using the autoradiographic method. Additional evidence concerning the origin of some intra-amygdaloid connections was provided by a series of rhesus monkeys with injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the amygdaloid complex. The experiments indicated that each of the major amygdaloid nuclei possesses a unique, organized set of intrinsic projections. Furthermore, there were large differences in the magnitude of the internal connections arising from or terminating in the various nuclei. The heaviest intrinsic projections arose from the lateral and basal nuclei while the central, medial, cortical, and accessory basal nuclei received the greatest number of these afferents. Thus, there was a clear trend for the bulk of these connections to run dorsally and medially within the amygdala. One important function of these intrinsic connections may be the integration of afferent sensory information from the various association areas which project to the amygdala.",

          "Citation": "\"The classification of the amygdaloid nuclei adopted in this study is based on the description of the primate amygdala by Crosby and Humphrey (1941). In brief, the amygdala has been divided into five \"deep\" nuclei and three \"superficial\" nuclei. The \"deep\" nuclei consist of the lateral, lateral basal, medial basal, accessory basal, and central nuclei. There is in addition a poorly defined anterior area, while the endopiriform nucleus lies between this anterior area and the claustrum. The \"superficial\" nuclei lie on the medial surface of the temopral lobe and include the medial and cortical nuclei, and the periamygdaloid cortex. There is also a cortical transition area lying between the periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortices and an amygdalo-hippocampal area lying at the caudal limit of the amygdala, adjacent to the hippocampus.\r\nThe positions of the major amygdaloid nuclei are shown in Fig. 1; the cytoarchitectural characteristics of these nuclei have been described elsewhere (Crosby and Humphrey 1941; Lauer 1945; Jimenez-Castellanos 1949; Aggleton and Mishkin 1984). Although many of these amygdaloid nuclei may be further subdivided (see Jimenez-Castellanos 1949) only two, the central and the accessory basal nuclei, possess clearly defined subareas (Price 1981a) which will be referred to in this report. The central nucleus contains a distinct medial, magnocellular division, while the accessopry basal nucleus may be split into a dorsal , magnocellular division and a ventral , parvocellular division. \r\nThe amygdaloid complex of the rhesus and cynomolgus monkey are very similar in appearance and this nuclear classification is appropriate to both species. The presence of a more prominent dorsolateral extension to the lateral basal nucleus in the cynomolgus monkey provides the only minor difference between these two closely related species.\" (p. 391)",

      "Citation": "\"The nomenclature and cytoarchitectonic characteristics of the amygdaloid nuclei have been described elsewhere (Crosby and Humphrey 1941; Jimenez-Castellanos 1949); Aggleton and Mishkin 1984). Of particular interest to this study are the lateral basal and medial basal nuclei, which some authors have combined to call the basolateral nucleus. This grouping reflects the indistinct border between the large, hyoerchromic cells of the lateral basal nucleus and the more irregular, more tightly packed cells of the medial basal nucleus. A ventral paralamellar portion can readily be distinguished within the medial basal nucleus (Amaral et al. 1982).\" (p. 516)",

      "Citation": "\"The classification of the amygdaloid nuclei adopted in this study is based on the description of the primate amygdala by Crosby and Humphrey (1941). In brief, the amygdala has been divided into five \"deep\" nuclei and three \"superficial\" nuclei. The \"deep\" nuclei consist of the lateral, lateral basal, medial basal, accessory basal, and central nuclei. There is in addition a poorly defined anterior area, while the endopiriform nucleus lies between this anterior area and the claustrum. The \"superficial\" nuclei lie on the medial surface of the temopral lobe and include the medial and cortical nuclei, and the periamygdaloid cortex. There is also a cortical transition area lying between the periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortices and an amygdalo-hippocampal area lying at the caudal limit of the amygdala, adjacent to the hippocampus. The positions of the major amygdaloid nuclei are shown in Fig. 1; the cytoarchitectural characteristics of these nuclei have been described elsewhere (Crosby and Humphrey 1941; Lauer 1945; Jimenez-Castellanos 1949; Aggleton and Mishkin 1984). Although many of these amygdaloid nuclei may be further subdivided (see Jimenez-Castellanos 1949) only two, the central and the accessory basal nuclei, possess clearly defined subareas (Price 1981a) which will be referred to in this report. The central nucleus contains a distinct medial, magnocellular division, while the accessopry basal nucleus may be split into a dorsal , magnocellular division and a ventral , parvocellular division. The amygdaloid complex of the rhesus and cynomolgus monkey are very similar in appearance and this nuclear classification is appropriate to both species. The presence of a more prominent dorsolateral extension to the lateral basal nucleus in the cynomolgus monkey provides the only minor difference between these two closely related species.\" (p. 391)",

There is in addition a poorly defined anterior area, while the endopiriform nucleus lies between this anterior area and the claustrum. The \"superficial\" nuclei lie on the medial surface of the temopral lobe and include the medial and cortical nuclei, and the periamygdaloid cortex. There is also a cortical transition area lying between the periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortices and an amygdalo-hippocampal area lying at the caudal limit of the amygdala, adjacent to the hippocampus. The positions of the major amygdaloid nuclei are shown in Fig. 1; the cytoarchitectural characteristics of these nuclei have been described elsewhere (Crosby and Humphrey 1941; Lauer 1945; Jimenez-Castellanos 1949; Aggleton and Mishkin 1984). Although many of these amygdaloid nuclei may be further subdivided (see Jimenez-Castellanos 1949) only two, the central and the accessory basal nuclei, possess clearly defined subareas (Price 1981a) which will be referred to in this report. The central nucleus contains a distinct medial, magnocellular division, while the accessopry basal nucleus may be split into a dorsal , magnocellular division and a ventral , parvocellular division. The amygdaloid complex of the rhesus and cynomolgus monkey are very similar in appearance and this nuclear classification is appropriate to both species. The presence of a more prominent dorsolateral extension to the lateral basal nucleus in the cynomolgus monkey provides the only minor difference between these two closely related species.\" (p. 391)",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic amygdaloid connections of the cynomolgus monkey were investigated using the autoradiographic method. Additional evidence concerning the origin of some intra-amygdaloid connections was provided by a series of rhesus monkeys with injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the amygdaloid complex. The experiments indicated that each of the major amygdaloid nuclei possesses a unique, organized set of intrinsic projections. Furthermore, there were large differences in the magnitude of the internal connections arising from or terminating in the various nuclei. The heaviest intrinsic projections arose from the lateral and basal nuclei while the central, medial, cortical, and accessory basal nuclei received the greatest number of these afferents. Thus, there was a clear trend for the bulk of these connections to run dorsally and medially within the amygdala. One important function of these intrinsic connections may be the integration of afferent sensory information from the various association areas which project to the amygdala.",
