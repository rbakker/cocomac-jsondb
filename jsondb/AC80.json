  "Title": "Subcortical afferents to the hippocampal formation in the monkey",
  "Abstract": "The distribution of neurons in the basal telencephalon, the diencephalon, and the brainstem that project to the hippocampal formation has been analyzed in mature cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) by the injection of horseradish peroxidase into different rostro-caudal levels of the hippocampal formation. After injections which involve Ammon's horn, the dentate gyrus, and the subicular complex, retrogradely labeled neurons are found in the following regions: in the amygdala (specifically in the anterior amygdaloid area, the basolateral nucleus, and the periamygdaloid cortex); in the medial septal nucleus and the nucleus of the diagonal band; in the ventral part of the claustrum; in the substantia innominata and the basal nucleus of Meynert; in the rostral thalamus (specifically in the anterior nuclear complex, the laterodorsal nucleus, the paraventricular and parataenial nuclei, the nucleus reuniens, and the nucleus centralis medialis); in the lateral preoptic and lateral hypothalamic areas, and especially in the supramammillary and retromammillary regions; in the ventral tegmental area, the tegmental reticular fields, the raphe nuclei (specifically in nucleus centralis superior and the dorsal raphe nucleus), in the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, the central gray, the dorsal tegmental nucleus, and in the locus coeruleus.",

Most of the cells were located in the ventromedial part of the basolateral nucleus, but some were also seen in the anterior amygdaloid area and others were scattered throughout the periamygdaloid cortex. At rostral levels, there were also a few labelled cells in the region between the claustrum and the amygdaloid complex in the area correspnding topographically to the endopiriform nucleus of the cat (Kettek and Price, '77). In experiment DMH-4, in which there was little involvement  of the subicular complex, there were relatively few cells labeled in the amygdala; those that were labeled were confined to the basolateral nucleus and the periamygdaloid cortex.\r\nThe finding of a projection from the basolateral nucleus and the periamygdaloid cortex to the subicular region confirms, for the monkey, the earlier observations of Krettek and Price ('77) in rats and cats. These authors reported that after injections of 3H-amino acids into the basolateral nucleus and the periamygdaloid cortex, label was transported anterogradely to the ventral part of the subiculum where it appeared to terminate in the deeper part of the plexiform layer. In their autoradiographs, radioactivity was also seen over the presubiculum, but the authors were inclined to attribute this to the presence of label in fibers that were passing    en route to the subiculum itself. In none of their experiments was any other component of the hippocampal formation labeled. After comparable injections limited to the periamygdaloid cortex, their autoradiographs showed the highest grain densities over the outer part of the plexiform layer of the subiculum, in a zone exactly complementary to that in which the fibers from the basolateral nucleus were found to terminate.\" (p. 577)",

Most of the cells were located in the ventromedial part of the basolateral nucleus, but some were also seen in the anterior amygdaloid area and others were scattered throughout the periamygdaloid cortex. At rostral levels, there were also a few labelled cells in the region between the claustrum and the amygdaloid complex in the area correspnding topographically to the endopiriform nucleus of the cat (Kettek and Price, '77). In experiment DMH-4, in which there was little involvement  of the subicular complex, there were relatively few cells labeled in the amygdala; those that were labeled were confined to the basolateral nucleus and the periamygdaloid cortex.\r\nThe finding of a projection from the basolateral nucleus and the periamygdaloid cortex to the subicular region confirms, for the monkey, the earlier observations of Krettek and Price ('77) in rats and cats. These authors reported that after injections of 3H-amino acids into the basolateral nucleus and the periamygdaloid cortex, label was transported anterogradely to the ventral part of the subiculum where it appeared to terminate in the deeper part of the plexiform layer. In their autoradiographs, radioactivity was also seen over the presubiculum, but the authors were inclined to attribute this to the presence of label in fibers that were passing    en route to the subiculum itself. In none of their experiments was any other component of the hippocampal formation labeled. After comparable injections limited to the periamygdaloid cortex, their autoradiographs showed the highest grain densities over the outer part of the plexiform layer of the subiculum, in a zone exactly complementary to that in which the fibers from the basolateral nucleus were found to terminate.\" (p. 577)",

After injections which involve Ammon's horn, the dentate gyrus, and the subicular complex, retrogradely labeled neurons are found in the following regions: in the amygdala (specifically in the anterior amygdaloid area, the basolateral nucleus, and the periamygdaloid cortex); in the medial septal nucleus and the nucleus of the diagonal band; in the ventral part of the claustrum; in the substantia innominata and the basal nucleus of Meynert; in the rostral thalamus (specifically in the anterior nuclear complex, the laterodorsal nucleus, the paraventricular and parataenial nuclei, the nucleus reuniens, and the nucleus centralis medialis); in the lateral preoptic and lateral hypothalamic areas, and especially in the supramammillary and retromammillary regions; in the ventral tegmental area, the tegmental reticular fields, the raphe nuclei (specifically in nucleus centralis superior and the dorsal raphe nucleus), in the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, the central gray, the dorsal tegmental nucleus, and in the locus coeruleus.",
