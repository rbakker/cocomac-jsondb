  "Title": "Direct projections from the ventral TE area of the inferotemporal cortex to the hippocampal field CA1 in the monkey",
  "Abstract": "Anterogradely labeled terminals were found densely in field CA1, but not in any other field, of the hippocampal formation following injections of horseradish peroxidase into the ventral TE area of the inferotemporal cortex, whereas no label was seen in any field of the hippocampal formation following injections into the dorsal TE area. The labeled terminals were distributed mainly in a medial part of the stratum moleculare of field CA1 throughout its rostrocaudal extent. The present finding provides the first demonstration of direct projections from the inferotemporal cortex to the hippocampal formation.",

      "Citation": "\"The delineations of cortical arae TE and the hippocampal formation were the same as were described in our previous study [7]. Area TE and its surrounding areas of TEO, TF, TH, TG and 35 (perirhinal ) were delineated on the cytoarchitectonic parcellations of von Bonin and Bailey [15] and Brodmann [1]. In this study, area TE was divided ointo the dorsal and ventral TE fields (TEd and TEv, respectively), because Brodmann [1] subdivided the inferotemporal cortex cytoarchitectonically into areas 20 and 21, which correspond to fields TEv and TEd, respectively. In fact, these two fields are different from each other in their connectivities with the amygdala [8]. The border between them was established as the anterior middle temporal sulcus and its caudal extension toward the gaze point in area V1. The delineations of the hippocampal formation were based on the descriptions of Lorente de Nò [9] and Van Hoesen and Pandya [14]. The hippocampal formation included 7 fields of the dentate gyrus, fields CA1-4, the prosubiculum and subiculum. Lorente de Nó [9] has subdivided field CA1 into 3 subfields named CA1a, CA1b, and CA1c. We adopted this classification to refer to the portion of label.

Area TE and its surrounding areas of TEO, TF, TH, TG and 35 (perirhinal ) were delineated on the cytoarchitectonic parcellations of von Bonin and Bailey [15] and Brodmann [1]. In this study, area TE was divided ointo the dorsal and ventral TE fields (TEd and TEv, respectively), because Brodmann [1] subdivided the inferotemporal cortex cytoarchitectonically into areas 20 and 21, which correspond to fields TEv and TEd, respectively. In fact, these two fields are different from each other in their connectivities with the amygdala [8]. The border between them was established as the anterior middle temporal sulcus and its caudal extension toward the gaze point in area V1. The delineations of the hippocampal formation were based on the descriptions of Lorente de Nò [9] and Van Hoesen and Pandya [14]. The hippocampal formation included 7 fields of the dentate gyrus, fields CA1-4, the prosubiculum and subiculum. Lorente de Nó [9] has subdivided field CA1 into 3 subfields named CA1a, CA1b, and CA1c. We adopted this classification to refer to the portion of label. Although Nissl-stained material do not clarify the borders between subfields CA1a, CA1b and CA1c, these subfields were defined as the medial, middle and lateral one-third of field CA1, respectively. The border between subfield CA1a and the prosubiculum was defined by the appearance of polymorph layer in the prosubiculum [9].\" (p. 7)",

The labeled terminals were distributed mainly in a medial part of the stratum moleculare of field CA1 throughout its rostrocaudal extent. The present finding provides the first demonstration of direct projections from the inferotemporal cortex to the hippocampal formation.",
