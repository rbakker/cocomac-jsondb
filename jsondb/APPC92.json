In primates, unfortunately, this usage may be confusing because many investigators have used the term basomedial (or mediobasal) for the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus.]. ...Lauer (1945), however, named this area the accessory basal nucleus and divided it into a lateral, large-celled portion and a medial, smaller-celled portion. These regions closely correspond to the magnocellular and parvicellular divisions, respectively, described by Price et al.(1987) and used in this chapter. Price et al. (1987) described an additional 'superficial division' of the accessory basal nucleus and Amaral and Bassett (1989) described a fourth division, the ventromedial division, which had distinctly higher levels of cholinergic markers. More recently, Pitkänen and Amaral (1991b) have evaluated the pattern of labeling of this region in preparations stained for the enzyme NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d). It became clear in this analysis that the region forerly called the superficial division of the accessory basal nucleus is more likely to be a rostral extension of the amygdalohippocampal area, and in this chapter the term superficial division of the accessory basal nucleus has been eliminated.\" (p. 11) \"The anterior portion of the amygdalohippocampal area was previously named the superficial portion of the accessory basal nucleus (Price et al., 1987). \" (p. 16)",

Johnston's basal nucleus actually comprised both the basal nucleus and the accessory basal nucleus as we have defined it. The accessory basal nucleus in our description was included in his ' medial, small-celled part of the basal amygdaloid nucleus '. Lauer (1945) departed from Johnston's nomenclature and used the term basal nucleus much as have done to refer to the lateral, large-celled part of Johnston's basal nucleus. Lauer further subdivided the basal nucleus into a dorsally located, lateral, large-celled part (which corresponds to the magnocellular division of Price etal., 1987) and a ventrally located, medial, small-celled part (equivalent to the parvicellular division of Price et al., 1987). Lauer noted that the most ventral aspect of his medial, small-celled part of the basal nucleus was distinct from the remainder of the nucleus and he called this area the ' superficial portion of medial part of basal amygdaloid nucleus' . This area corresponds to what we have called the paralaminar nucleus. There are still a variety of names applied to the monkey basal nucleus (Fig. 2). One common variant uses the terms \"lateral basal\" or \"basolateral\" when referring to the magnocellular division of the basal nucleus and the terms \"medial basal\" or \"basomedial\" when referring to the parvicellular division. ...Dorsal to the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus is the intermediate division. The cells here are larger, more densely packed, and more darkly stained than in the parvicellular division. The dorsoventral border between the parvicellular and intermediate divisions of the basal nucleus extend further dorsally on the lateral and medial edges of the nucleus. Price et al. (1987) did not distinguish the intermediate division. The intermediate division contains higher levels of the cholinergic markers than the parvicellular division but lower levels than in the magnocellular division (Amaral and Basset, 1989).\" (p. 10)",

As many as six and as few as one subdivisions have been attributed to the primate lateral nucleus (Fig. 2; Johnston, 1923; Lauer, 1945; Jimenez-Castellanos, 1949; Koikegami, 1963). In this chapter, we use the nomenclature of Price et al. (1987) as slightly modified by Amaral and Bassett (1989). Thus, the lateral nucleus of the Macaca fascicularis monkey has been subdivided into dorsomedial and ventrolateral divisions (Table I, Fig. 1C) based largely on differences in Nissl and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining (Amaral and Bassett, 1989). ...Along the lateral edge of the lateral nucleus there are occasionally patches of tightly packed, small neurons which are encapsulated by fiber bundles emanating from the external capsule. These cell groups were called the lateral capsular nuclei by Amaral and Bassett (1989) and stained intensely for AChE and choline acetytransferase (ChAT).\" (pp. 7,9)",

In primates, unfortunately, this usage may be confusing because many investigators have used the term basomedial (or mediobasal) for the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus.]. ...Lauer (1945), however, named this area the accessory basal nucleus and divided it into a lateral, large-celled portion and a medial, smaller-celled portion. These regions closely correspond to the magnocellular and parvicellular divisions, respectively, described by Price et al.(1987) and used in this chapter. Price et al. (1987) described an additional 'superficial division' of the accessory basal nucleus and Amaral and Bassett (1989) described a fourth division, the ventromedial division, which had distinctly higher levels of cholinergic markers. More recently, Pitkänen and Amaral (1991b) have evaluated the pattern of labeling of this region in preparations stained for the enzyme NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d). It became clear in this analysis that the region forerly called the superficial division of the accessory basal nucleus is more likely to be a rostral extension of the amygdalohippocampal area, and in this chapter the term superficial division of the accessory basal nucleus has been eliminated.\" (p. 11) \"The anterior portion of the amygdalohippocampal area was previously named the superficial portion of the accessory basal nucleus (Price et al., 1987). \" (p. 16)",
