  "Title": "Amygdalar connections with middle and inferior temporal gyri of the monkey",
  "Abstract": "The origins and terminations of the amygdalar connections with middle (ITm) and inferior temporal (ITi) gyri of inferotemporal cortex (area TE) were studied in Japanese monkeys by the horseradish peroxidase method. The ITm gyrus received a major projection from the lateral basal nucleus and a minor one from the accessory basal nucleus of the amygdala, whereas it sent a major projection to the lateral nucleus and a minor one to the lateral basal nucleus. The ITi gyrus had only minor amygdalar projections from the medial basal nucleus and to the medial basal and lateral nuclei.",

The ITm gyrus received a major projection from the lateral basal nucleus and a minor one from the accessory basal nucleus of the amygdala, whereas it sent a major projection to the lateral nucleus and a minor one to the lateral basal nucleus. The ITi gyrus had only minor amygdalar projections from the medial basal nucleus and to the medial basal and lateral nuclei.",
