The cephalic pole lies in intimate relation with the cortical amygdaloid nucleus. Its caudal tip appears caudal to the posterior poles of the basal and lateral nuclei. Previous writers have made a subdivision of the accessory basal nucleus into medial and lateral portions. In the present reconstructive study and according to the cellular disposition 4 portions can be recognized in the accessory basal nucleus of the monkey: partes magnocellularis, mediocellularis, densocellularis and mixtocellularis. A secondary subdivision of the magnocellular portion into a lateral and medial part is evident. The pars magnocellularis lateralis (macl, figs. 4-6) is located laterodorsal within the accessory basal nucleus laterally, contains the largest neurons of this nucleus, and appears homogeneous and deeply stained. The pars magnocellularis medialis (macm, figs. 2-6) has a medial situation within the accessory nucleus.It contains an intermingling of small and large neurons. These nuclei are in relation with the pars magnocellularis lateralis, the mediocellularis and the densocellularis. The mediocellular portion (mec, figs. 2-6) is located between both magnocellular portions and is very similar histologically to the medial portion but can be recognized because its cellular density is poorer. Thepars mixtocellularis (mic, figs. 4-6) occupies a ventrocaudal situation in the accessory nucleus containing small and medium sized cells, with a preponderance of granular neurons.The densocellular portion (dc, figs. 4-5) is a small rounded mass that appears in the accessory nucleus between the medial magnocellular and the mediocellular portions, in the medial third of the longitudinal axis of this nucleus.\" (p. 518)",

The cephalic pole lies in intimate relation with the cortical amygdaloid nucleus. Its caudal tip appears caudal to the posterior poles of the basal and lateral nuclei. Previous writers have made a subdivision of the accessory basal nucleus into medial and lateral portions. In the present reconstructive study and according to the cellular disposition 4 portions can be recognized in the accessory basal nucleus of the monkey: partes magnocellularis, mediocellularis, densocellularis and mixtocellularis. A secondary subdivision of the magnocellular portion into a lateral and medial part is evident. The pars magnocellularis lateralis (macl, figs. 4-6) is located laterodorsal within the accessory basal nucleus laterally, contains the largest neurons of this nucleus, and appears homogeneous and deeply stained. The pars magnocellularis medialis (macm, figs. 2-6) has a medial situation within the accessory nucleus.It contains an intermingling of small and large neurons. These nuclei are in relation with the pars magnocellularis lateralis, the mediocellularis and the densocellularis. The mediocellular portion (mec, figs. 2-6) is located between both magnocellular portions and is very similar histologically to the medial portion but can be recognized because its cellular density is poorer. Thepars mixtocellularis (mic, figs. 4-6) occupies a ventrocaudal situation in the accessory nucleus containing small and medium sized cells, with a preponderance of granular neurons.The densocellular portion (dc, figs. 4-5) is a small rounded mass that appears in the accessory nucleus between the medial magnocellular and the mediocellular portions, in the medial third of the longitudinal axis of this nucleus.\" (p. 518)",

In this work the cortical amygdaloid nucleus has been studied with the criteria of the German writer in mind and the following considerations and secondary subdivisions have been made: superficially, the periamygdaleum is composed of portions of the second cortical layer and contains small and very numerous deeply stained pyramidal neurons. These layers do not present a continuity as in the cortex and they can be divided into (1) an oral part with dorsal (pAid, figs. 1-2) and ventral (pAov, figs. 1-2) divisions; (2) and intermediate part with dorsal (pAd, figs. 3-5) intermediate (pAi, figs. 3-5) and ventral (pAcv, fig. 6) divisions. The amygdaleum superficiale (Asf, figs. 1-6) is the representation of other cortical layer in the amygdala, but it cannot be subdivided, forming instead a heteregeneous portion with no specific cellular composition. Morphologically, this portion forms a large layer medial to the basolateral group, and has two poles (caudal and oral) and intermediate portion. Dorsal and ventral parts are distinguishable in each of these subdivisions. All these structures are shown in the accompanying reconstruction and together form the cortical nucleus of previous writers.\" (p. 520)",
