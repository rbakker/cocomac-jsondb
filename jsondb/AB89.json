  "Title": "Cholinergic innervation of the monkey amygdala: An immunohistochemical analysis with antisera to choline acetyltransferase",
  "Abstract": "The organization of the cholinergic innervation of the macaque monkey amygdaloid complex was investigated by means of immunohistochemical techniques and either a polyclonal antiserum or a monoclonal antibody directed against the specific synthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Adjacent series of sections were processed histochemically for the demonstration of the degradative enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or for cell bodies with thionin. The density of ChAT immunoreactivity differed substantially among the various nuclei and cortical regions of the amygdala. In general, the distribution of ChAT immunoreactivity paralleled the pattern of AChE staining. One notable exception was the presence of AChE containing cell bodies in addition to AChE positive fibers within nearly all of the nuclear and cortical regions. In contrast, ChAT immunoreactivity was associated only with fibers and terminals. The highest density of ChAT immunoreactive fibers and terminals was consistently observed in the magnocellular subdivision of the basal nucleus. Staining was substantially less dense in the more ventrally situated parvicellular subdivision. Medially, in the adjacent accessory basal nucleus, immunoreactive fibers and terminals were densest in the magnocellular and superficial subdivisions and least prominent in the parvicellular subdivision. Of the deep nuclei, the lateral nucleus generally obtained the least ChAT immunoreactive terminals and processes. Only its more densely cellular ventrolateral portion contained appreciable fiber and terminal staining. One of the more distinctive patterns of ChAT immunoreactivity was seen in the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. Here, ChAT positive fibers formed pericellular basket plexuses around unstained cell bodies. This unique pattern of staining was used to delineate the boundaries of the nucleus and indicated that it is present for much of the rostrocaudal extent of the amygdala. Another region of conspicuous staining on the medial surface of the amygdala was the sulcal portion of the periamygdaloid cortex. This region, associated with the sulcus semiannularis and bordering the entorhinal cortex, consistently contained dense immunoreactivity. The central nucleus also presented a somewhat idiosyncratic pattern of ChAT staining. The lateral subdivision had a diffuse distribution of immunoreactivity in which focal patches of more densely stained terminals and occasional fine fibers were embedded. In contrast, the medial subdivision contained a larger number of thicker, stained fibers without diffuse background labeling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

('87) recognized three subdivisions of the accessory basal nucleus: a dorsally situated magnocellular subdivision (ABmg), a ventrally situated parvicellular division (ABpc), and a medially situated superficial subdivision (ABs) (Figs. 5,6). In the current study we noted at least two other distinct populations of neurons that stained heavily for ChAT and AChE, which were situated ventromedial to rostral levels of the AB. ...Since the rostrally situated patches appeared different from ABs both cytoarchitectonically and in their ChAT and AChE staining, we have considered them to constitute a separate region of AB and labeled it the ventromedial subdivision (ABvm, Fig. 4). ...The ABs was initially separated from the ABpc primarily because it stained heavily for AChE (Price et al., '87). Our preparations have confirmed this and demonstrate further that the ABs contained a moderate density of ChAT immunoreactive fibers and terminals (Fig. 5).

We have therefore made minor modifications to the nomenclature suggested by Price et al. ('87).\" (p. 329) \"Whereas we have previously divided the basal nucleus into a dorsal magnocellular division and a ventral parvicellular division, in the current analyses we noted in the thionin-stained material and in the ChAT and AChE preparations that there were indications of three dorsoventrally situated subdivisions in the basal nucleus that changed from one to another in a gradual fashion (Figs. 2-7). ...Situated between the Bmg and the parvicellular division (Bpc) was a portion of the basal nucleus that we have labeled the intermediate subdivision (Bi).\" (p. 340)",
      "Comments": "It should be noticed that the basal amygdaloid nucleus of AB89 has 3 subdivisions (AB89-Bi, -Bmg, Bpc) and that of PRA87 only 2 subdivisions (PRA87-Bmg, -Bpc). Because of (i) the location of the subdivisions and (ii) of the description of cell sizes and immunohistochemistry it seems that AB89-Bi overlaps with PRA87-Bmg and (!) -Bpc and that AB89-Bpc and AB89-Bmg are subparts of PRA87-Bpc and PRA87-Bmg, respectively, because PRA87 didn't describe an intermediate subdivision in contrast to AB89.",

    "title": "Cholinergic innervation of the monkey amygdala: An immunohistochemical analysis with antisera to choline acetyltransferase",
    "abstract": "The organization of the cholinergic innervation of the macaque monkey amygdaloid complex was investigated by means of immunohistochemical techniques and either a polyclonal antiserum or a monoclonal antibody directed against the specific synthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Adjacent series of sections were processed histochemically for the demonstration of the degradative enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or for cell bodies with thionin. The density of ChAT immunoreactivity differed substantially among the various nuclei and cortical regions of the amygdala. In general, the distribution of ChAT immunoreactivity paralleled the pattern of AChE staining. One notable exception was the presence of AChE containing cell bodies in addition to AChE positive fibers within nearly all of the nuclear and cortical regions. In contrast, ChAT immunoreactivity was associated only with fibers and terminals. The highest density of ChAT immunoreactive fibers and terminals was consistently observed in the magnocellular subdivision of the basal nucleus. Staining was substantially less dense in the more ventrally situated parvicellular subdivision. Medially, in the adjacent accessory basal nucleus, immunoreactive fibers and terminals were densest in the magnocellular and superficial subdivisions and least prominent in the parvicellular subdivision. Of the deep nuclei, the lateral nucleus generally obtained the least ChAT immunoreactive terminals and processes. Only its more densely cellular ventrolateral portion contained appreciable fiber and terminal staining. One of the more distinctive patterns of ChAT immunoreactivity was seen in the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. Here, ChAT positive fibers formed pericellular basket plexuses around unstained cell bodies. This unique pattern of staining was used to delineate the boundaries of the nucleus and indicated that it is present for much of the rostrocaudal extent of the amygdala. Another region of conspicuous staining on the medial surface of the amygdala was the sulcal portion of the periamygdaloid cortex. This region, associated with the sulcus semiannularis and bordering the entorhinal cortex, consistently contained dense immunoreactivity. The central nucleus also presented a somewhat idiosyncratic pattern of ChAT staining. The lateral subdivision had a diffuse distribution of immunoreactivity in which focal patches of more densely stained terminals and occasional fine fibers were embedded. In contrast, the medial subdivision contained a larger number of thicker, stained fibers without diffuse background labeling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
