  "Title": "Topographically specific hippocampal projections target functionally distinct prefrontal areas in the rhesus monkey",
  "Abstract": "The sources of ipsilateral projections from the hippocampal formation, the presubiculum, area 29a-c, and parasubiculum to medial, orbital, and lateral prefrontal cortices were studied with retrograde tracers in 27 rhesus monkeys. Labeled neurons within the hippocampal formation (CA1, CA1', prosubiculum, and subiculum) were found rostrally, although some were noted throughout the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation. Most labeled neurons in the hippocampal formation projected to medial prefrontal cortices, followed by orbital areas. In addition, there were differences in the topography of afferent neurons projecting to medial when compared with orbital cortices. Labeled neurons innervating medial cortices were found mainly in the CA1' and CA1 fields rostrally, but originated in the subicular fields caudally. In contrast, labeled neurons which innervated orbital cortices were considerably more focal, emanating from the same relative position within a field throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation. In marked contrast to the pattern of projection to medial and orbital prefrontal cortices, lateral prefrontal areas received projections from only a few labeled neurons found mostly in the subicular fields. Lateral prefrontal cortices received the most robust projections from the presubiculum and the supracallosal area 29a-c. Orbital, and to a lesser extent medial, prefrontal areas received projections from a smaller but significant number of neurons from the presubiculum and area 29a-c. Only a few labeled neurons were found in the parasubiculum, and most projected to medial prefrontal areas. The results suggest that functionally distinct prefrontal cortices receive projections from different components of the hippocampal region. Medial and orbital prefrontal cortices may have a role in long-term mnemonic processes similar to those associated with the hippocampal formation with which they are linked. Moreover, the preponderance of projection neurons from the hippocampal formation innervating medial when compared with orbital prefrontal areas followed the opposite trend from what we had observed previously for the amygdala (Barbas and De Olmos [1990] (J Comp Neurol 301:1-23). Thus, the hippocampal formation, associated with mnemonic processes, targets predominantly medial prefrontal cortices, whereas the amygdala, associated with emotional aspects of memory, issues robust projections to orbital limbic cortices. Lateral prefrontal cortices receive robust projections from the presubiculum and area 29a-c and sparse projections from the hippocampal formation. These findings are consistent with the idea that the role of lateral prefrontal cortices in memory is distinct from that of either medial or orbital cortices. The results suggest that signals from functionally distinct limbic structures to some extent follow parallel pathways to functionally distinct prefrontal cortices.",

The term hippocampal formation in this report refers to the dentate gyrus, fields CA1-CA4, the prosubiculum, and subiculum (for review, see Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The term hippocampal formation has also been employed more broadly to include all of the above regions as well as the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and the entorhinal cortex (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). Here we will present the projections of the hippocampal formation in its narrower sense and distinguish them from those emanating from the presubiculum and parasubiculum. The reason for the distinction is based on structural grounds (Rosene Van Hoesen, 1987). The fields of the hippocampal formation belong to the allocortical architectonic type (Figs. 1), whereas the presubiculum and parasubiculum can be considered periallocortical (Saunders and Rosene, 1988). Projections from the entorhinal cortex, which were included in cortical studies previously (e.g., Barbas, 1993), will not be considered here.\r\nInvestigators generally agree on the borders of the various hippocampal fields, although there are some differences in the precise terminology used (for discussion, see Amaral, 1987; Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The minor differences encountered commonly in the modern literature will be pointed out briefly so that comparisons can be made among studies that use one or the other convention. Investigators who have adhered to the parceling of Lorente de No´(1934) have distinguished between an area called the prosubiculum and the subiculum (Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987), whereas others consider the entire region to be part of the subiculum (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). In this report we have retained the designation prosubiculum because its borders are prominently defined by acetylcholinesterase (AChE; Fig. 2). Another difference centers on the term used for the rostral field, designated CA1'  by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987), but considered to be part of the subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). Finally, the ammonic field which dips into the hilar region has been referred to as CA4 in the nomenclature of Lorente de No' (1934), but is considered to be the continuation of CA3 by Amaral and lnsausti (1990).\" (pp. 513, 514)\r\n\r\n\"The Presubiculum and Area 29a-c\r\nThe presubiculum (area 27 of Brodmann, 1909) and parasubicuulum (area 49 of Brodmann, 1909) differ from the fields included in the hippocampal formation on structural grounds. As shown in Figure 1, the presubiculum has a clearly delineated dense upper layer, and a less well-defined deep cellular layer invaded partly by the medial extension of the subiculum (see also Amaral and Insausti, 1990). The presubiculum gives way to the parasubiculum medially, which has a less densely packed external cellular layer than the presubiculum (Fig. 1A-C) and has a dense plexus of AChE in the upper layers (Fig. 2A, B). The presubiculum is situated next to the subiculum and is readily recognizable near the subcallosal part of the subiculum. Stucturally the presubiculum resembles the dorsally situated area 29a-c. However, even though several investigators have recognized that a small part of the subiculum extends dorsally above the corpus callosum, the adjacent region has been designated area 29a-c (Vogt et al., 1987) and has been differentiated from the presubiculum situated below the corpus callosum. Our observations indicate that the presubiculum is topographically continuous with area 29a-c. In addition, we have noted a close strucutural relationship between the presubiculum and area 29a-c, as seen in Nissl sections taken from a level just before and immediately caudal to the splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig. 12). We entertain the possibility that the presubiuculum and area 29a-c may be the same area. In this section we will continue to distinguish the ventrally situated presubiculum from the dorsally situated area 29a-c according to convention, but with the above idea in mind.\" (pp. 519, 522, 524 )",

Our observations indicate that the presubiculum is topographically continuous with area 29a-c.

The term hippocampal formation in this report refers to the dentate gyrus, fields CA1-CA4, the prosubiculum, and subiculum (for review, see Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The term hippocampal formation has also been employed more broadly to include all of the above regions as well as the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and the entorhinal cortex (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). Here we will present the projections of the hippocampal formation in its narrower sense and distinguish them from those emanating from the presubiculum and parasubiculum. The reason for the distinction is based on structural grounds (Rosene Van Hoesen, 1987). The fields of the hippocampal formation belong to the allocortical architectonic type (Figs. 1), whereas the presubiculum and parasubiculum can be considered periallocortical (Saunders and Rosene, 1988). Projections from the entorhinal cortex, which were included in cortical studies previously (e.g., Barbas, 1993), will not be considered here. Investigators generally agree on the borders of the various hippocampal fields, although there are some differences in the precise terminology used (for discussion, see Amaral, 1987; Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The minor differences encountered commonly in the modern literature will be pointed out briefly so that comparisons can be made among studies that use one or the other convention. Investigators who have adhered to the parceling of Lorente de No´(1934) have distinguished between an area called the prosubiculum and the subiculum (Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987), whereas others consider the entire region to be part of the subiculum (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). In this report we have retained the designation prosubiculum because its borders are prominently defined by acetylcholinesterase (AChE; Fig. 2). Another difference centers on the term used for the rostral field, designated CA1' by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987), but considered to be part of the subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). Finally, the ammonic field which dips into the hilar region has been referred to as CA4 in the nomenclature of Lorente de No' (1934), but is considered to be the continuation of CA3 by Amaral and lnsausti (1990).\" (pp. 513, 514) \"The Presubiculum and Area 29a-c The presubiculum (area 27 of Brodmann, 1909) and parasubicuulum (area 49 of Brodmann, 1909) differ from the fields included in the hippocampal formation on structural grounds. As shown in Figure 1, the presubiculum has a clearly delineated dense upper layer, and a less well-defined deep cellular layer invaded partly by the medial extension of the subiculum (see also Amaral and Insausti, 1990).

In this report we have retained the designation prosubiculum because its borders are prominently defined by acetylcholinesterase (AChE; Fig. 2). Another difference centers on the term used for the rostral field, designated CA1' by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987), but considered to be part of the subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). Finally, the ammonic field which dips into the hilar region has been referred to as CA4 in the nomenclature of Lorente de No' (1934), but is considered to be the continuation of CA3 by Amaral and lnsausti (1990).\" (pp. 513, 514) \"The Presubiculum and Area 29a-c The presubiculum (area 27 of Brodmann, 1909) and parasubicuulum (area 49 of Brodmann, 1909) differ from the fields included in the hippocampal formation on structural grounds. As shown in Figure 1, the presubiculum has a clearly delineated dense upper layer, and a less well-defined deep cellular layer invaded partly by the medial extension of the subiculum (see also Amaral and Insausti, 1990). The presubiculum gives way to the parasubiculum medially, which has a less densely packed external cellular layer than the presubiculum (Fig. 1A-C) and has a dense plexus of AChE in the upper layers (Fig. 2A, B). The presubiculum is situated next to the subiculum and is readily recognizable near the subcallosal part of the subiculum. Stucturally the presubiculum resembles the dorsally situated area 29a-c. However, even though several investigators have recognized that a small part of the subiculum extends dorsally above the corpus callosum, the adjacent region has been designated area 29a-c (Vogt et al., 1987) and has been differentiated from the presubiculum situated below the corpus callosum. Our observations indicate that the presubiculum is topographically continuous with area 29a-c. In addition, we have noted a close strucutural relationship between the presubiculum and area 29a-c, as seen in Nissl sections taken from a level just before and immediately caudal to the splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig. 12). We entertain the possibility that the presubiuculum and area 29a-c may be the same area.

The term hippocampal formation in this report refers to the dentate gyrus, fields CA1-CA4, the prosubiculum, and subiculum (for review, see Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The term hippocampal formation has also been employed more broadly to include all of the above regions as well as the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and the entorhinal cortex (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). Here we will present the projections of the hippocampal formation in its narrower sense and distinguish them from those emanating from the presubiculum and parasubiculum. The reason for the distinction is based on structural grounds (Rosene Van Hoesen, 1987). The fields of the hippocampal formation belong to the allocortical architectonic type (Figs. 1), whereas the presubiculum and parasubiculum can be considered periallocortical (Saunders and Rosene, 1988). Projections from the entorhinal cortex, which were included in cortical studies previously (e.g., Barbas, 1993), will not be considered here. Investigators generally agree on the borders of the various hippocampal fields, although there are some differences in the precise terminology used (for discussion, see Amaral, 1987; Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The minor differences encountered commonly in the modern literature will be pointed out briefly so that comparisons can be made among studies that use one or the other convention. Investigators who have adhered to the parceling of Lorente de No´(1934) have distinguished between an area called the prosubiculum and the subiculum (Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987), whereas others consider the entire region to be part of the subiculum (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). In this report we have retained the designation prosubiculum because its borders are prominently defined by acetylcholinesterase (AChE; Fig. 2). Another difference centers on the term used for the rostral field, designated CA1' by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987), but considered to be part of the subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). Finally, the ammonic field which dips into the hilar region has been referred to as CA4 in the nomenclature of Lorente de No' (1934), but is considered to be the continuation of CA3 by Amaral and lnsausti (1990).\" (pp. 513, 514) \"The Presubiculum and Area 29a-c The presubiculum (area 27 of Brodmann, 1909) and parasubicuulum (area 49 of Brodmann, 1909) differ from the fields included in the hippocampal formation on structural grounds. As shown in Figure 1, the presubiculum has a clearly delineated dense upper layer, and a less well-defined deep cellular layer invaded partly by the medial extension of the subiculum (see also Amaral and Insausti, 1990). The presubiculum gives way to the parasubiculum medially, which has a less densely packed external cellular layer than the presubiculum (Fig. 1A-C) and has a dense plexus of AChE in the upper layers (Fig. 2A, B). The presubiculum is situated next to the subiculum and is readily recognizable near the subcallosal part of the subiculum. Stucturally the presubiculum resembles the dorsally situated area 29a-c. However, even though several investigators have recognized that a small part of the subiculum extends dorsally above the corpus callosum, the adjacent region has been designated area 29a-c (Vogt et al., 1987) and has been differentiated from the presubiculum situated below the corpus callosum. Our observations indicate that the presubiculum is topographically continuous with area 29a-c. In addition, we have noted a close strucutural relationship between the presubiculum and area 29a-c, as seen in Nissl sections taken from a level just before and immediately caudal to the splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig. 12). We entertain the possibility that the presubiuculum and area 29a-c may be the same area.

The term hippocampal formation in this report refers to the dentate gyrus, fields CA1-CA4, the prosubiculum, and subiculum (for review, see Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The term hippocampal formation has also been employed more broadly to include all of the above regions as well as the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and the entorhinal cortex (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). Here we will present the projections of the hippocampal formation in its narrower sense and distinguish them from those emanating from the presubiculum and parasubiculum. The reason for the distinction is based on structural grounds (Rosene Van Hoesen, 1987). The fields of the hippocampal formation belong to the allocortical architectonic type (Figs. 1), whereas the presubiculum and parasubiculum can be considered periallocortical (Saunders and Rosene, 1988).

The minor differences encountered commonly in the modern literature will be pointed out briefly so that comparisons can be made among studies that use one or the other convention. Investigators who have adhered to the parceling of Lorente de No´(1934) have distinguished between an area called the prosubiculum and the subiculum (Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987), whereas others consider the entire region to be part of the subiculum (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). In this report we have retained the designation prosubiculum because its borders are prominently defined by acetylcholinesterase (AChE; Fig. 2). Another difference centers on the term used for the rostral field, designated CA1' by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987), but considered to be part of the subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). Finally, the ammonic field which dips into the hilar region has been referred to as CA4 in the nomenclature of Lorente de No' (1934), but is considered to be the continuation of CA3 by Amaral and lnsausti (1990).\" (pp. 513, 514) \"The Presubiculum and Area 29a-c The presubiculum (area 27 of Brodmann, 1909) and parasubicuulum (area 49 of Brodmann, 1909) differ from the fields included in the hippocampal formation on structural grounds. As shown in Figure 1, the presubiculum has a clearly delineated dense upper layer, and a less well-defined deep cellular layer invaded partly by the medial extension of the subiculum (see also Amaral and Insausti, 1990).

Another difference centers on the term used for the rostral field, designated CA1' by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987), but considered to be part of the subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990).

As shown in Figure 1, the presubiculum has a clearly delineated dense upper layer, and a less well-defined deep cellular layer invaded partly by the medial extension of the subiculum (see also Amaral and Insausti, 1990). The presubiculum gives way to the parasubiculum medially, which has a less densely packed external cellular layer than the presubiculum (Fig. 1A-C) and has a dense plexus of AChE in the upper layers (Fig. 2A, B). The presubiculum is situated next to the subiculum and is readily recognizable near the subcallosal part of the subiculum. Stucturally the presubiculum resembles the dorsally situated area 29a-c.

Our observations indicate that the presubiculum is topographically continuous with area 29a-c.

The term hippocampal formation has also been employed more broadly to include all of the above regions as well as the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and the entorhinal cortex (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). Here we will present the projections of the hippocampal formation in its narrower sense and distinguish them from those emanating from the presubiculum and parasubiculum. The reason for the distinction is based on structural grounds (Rosene Van Hoesen, 1987). The fields of the hippocampal formation belong to the allocortical architectonic type (Figs. 1), whereas the presubiculum and parasubiculum can be considered periallocortical (Saunders and Rosene, 1988). Projections from the entorhinal cortex, which were included in cortical studies previously (e.g., Barbas, 1993), will not be considered here. Investigators generally agree on the borders of the various hippocampal fields, although there are some differences in the precise terminology used (for discussion, see Amaral, 1987; Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The minor differences encountered commonly in the modern literature will be pointed out briefly so that comparisons can be made among studies that use one or the other convention. Investigators who have adhered to the parceling of Lorente de No´(1934) have distinguished between an area called the prosubiculum and the subiculum (Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987), whereas others consider the entire region to be part of the subiculum (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). In this report we have retained the designation prosubiculum because its borders are prominently defined by acetylcholinesterase (AChE; Fig. 2). Another difference centers on the term used for the rostral field, designated CA1' by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987), but considered to be part of the subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). Finally, the ammonic field which dips into the hilar region has been referred to as CA4 in the nomenclature of Lorente de No' (1934), but is considered to be the continuation of CA3 by Amaral and lnsausti (1990).\" (pp. 513, 514) \"The Presubiculum and Area 29a-c The presubiculum (area 27 of Brodmann, 1909) and parasubicuulum (area 49 of Brodmann, 1909) differ from the fields included in the hippocampal formation on structural grounds. As shown in Figure 1, the presubiculum has a clearly delineated dense upper layer, and a less well-defined deep cellular layer invaded partly by the medial extension of the subiculum (see also Amaral and Insausti, 1990). The presubiculum gives way to the parasubiculum medially, which has a less densely packed external cellular layer than the presubiculum (Fig. 1A-C) and has a dense plexus of AChE in the upper layers (Fig. 2A, B). The presubiculum is situated next to the subiculum and is readily recognizable near the subcallosal part of the subiculum. Stucturally the presubiculum resembles the dorsally situated area 29a-c. However, even though several investigators have recognized that a small part of the subiculum extends dorsally above the corpus callosum, the adjacent region has been designated area 29a-c (Vogt et al., 1987) and has been differentiated from the presubiculum situated below the corpus callosum. Our observations indicate that the presubiculum is topographically continuous with area 29a-c. In addition, we have noted a close strucutural relationship between the presubiculum and area 29a-c, as seen in Nissl sections taken from a level just before and immediately caudal to the splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig. 12). We entertain the possibility that the presubiuculum and area 29a-c may be the same area.

The term hippocampal formation in this report refers to the dentate gyrus, fields CA1-CA4, the prosubiculum, and subiculum (for review, see Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The term hippocampal formation has also been employed more broadly to include all of the above regions as well as the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and the entorhinal cortex (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). Here we will present the projections of the hippocampal formation in its narrower sense and distinguish them from those emanating from the presubiculum and parasubiculum. The reason for the distinction is based on structural grounds (Rosene Van Hoesen, 1987). The fields of the hippocampal formation belong to the allocortical architectonic type (Figs. 1), whereas the presubiculum and parasubiculum can be considered periallocortical (Saunders and Rosene, 1988). Projections from the entorhinal cortex, which were included in cortical studies previously (e.g., Barbas, 1993), will not be considered here. Investigators generally agree on the borders of the various hippocampal fields, although there are some differences in the precise terminology used (for discussion, see Amaral, 1987; Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The minor differences encountered commonly in the modern literature will be pointed out briefly so that comparisons can be made among studies that use one or the other convention. Investigators who have adhered to the parceling of Lorente de No´(1934) have distinguished between an area called the prosubiculum and the subiculum (Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987), whereas others consider the entire region to be part of the subiculum (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). In this report we have retained the designation prosubiculum because its borders are prominently defined by acetylcholinesterase (AChE; Fig. 2). Another difference centers on the term used for the rostral field, designated CA1' by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987), but considered to be part of the subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). Finally, the ammonic field which dips into the hilar region has been referred to as CA4 in the nomenclature of Lorente de No' (1934), but is considered to be the continuation of CA3 by Amaral and lnsausti (1990).\" (pp. 513, 514) \"The Presubiculum and Area 29a-c The presubiculum (area 27 of Brodmann, 1909) and parasubicuulum (area 49 of Brodmann, 1909) differ from the fields included in the hippocampal formation on structural grounds. As shown in Figure 1, the presubiculum has a clearly delineated dense upper layer, and a less well-defined deep cellular layer invaded partly by the medial extension of the subiculum (see also Amaral and Insausti, 1990). The presubiculum gives way to the parasubiculum medially, which has a less densely packed external cellular layer than the presubiculum (Fig. 1A-C) and has a dense plexus of AChE in the upper layers (Fig. 2A, B). The presubiculum is situated next to the subiculum and is readily recognizable near the subcallosal part of the subiculum. Stucturally the presubiculum resembles the dorsally situated area 29a-c. However, even though several investigators have recognized that a small part of the subiculum extends dorsally above the corpus callosum, the adjacent region has been designated area 29a-c (Vogt et al., 1987) and has been differentiated from the presubiculum situated below the corpus callosum. Our observations indicate that the presubiculum is topographically continuous with area 29a-c. In addition, we have noted a close strucutural relationship between the presubiculum and area 29a-c, as seen in Nissl sections taken from a level just before and immediately caudal to the splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig. 12).

However, even though several investigators have recognized that a small part of the subiculum extends dorsally above the corpus callosum, the adjacent region has been designated area 29a-c (Vogt et al., 1987) and has been differentiated from the presubiculum situated below the corpus callosum. Our observations indicate that the presubiculum is topographically continuous with area 29a-c. In addition, we have noted a close strucutural relationship between the presubiculum and area 29a-c, as seen in Nissl sections taken from a level just before and immediately caudal to the splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig. 12).

The term hippocampal formation in this report refers to the dentate gyrus, fields CA1-CA4, the prosubiculum, and subiculum (for review, see Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The term hippocampal formation has also been employed more broadly to include all of the above regions as well as the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and the entorhinal cortex (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). Here we will present the projections of the hippocampal formation in its narrower sense and distinguish them from those emanating from the presubiculum and parasubiculum. The reason for the distinction is based on structural grounds (Rosene Van Hoesen, 1987). The fields of the hippocampal formation belong to the allocortical architectonic type (Figs. 1), whereas the presubiculum and parasubiculum can be considered periallocortical (Saunders and Rosene, 1988). Projections from the entorhinal cortex, which were included in cortical studies previously (e.g., Barbas, 1993), will not be considered here.

The minor differences encountered commonly in the modern literature will be pointed out briefly so that comparisons can be made among studies that use one or the other convention. Investigators who have adhered to the parceling of Lorente de No´(1934) have distinguished between an area called the prosubiculum and the subiculum (Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987), whereas others consider the entire region to be part of the subiculum (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). In this report we have retained the designation prosubiculum because its borders are prominently defined by acetylcholinesterase (AChE; Fig. 2). Another difference centers on the term used for the rostral field, designated CA1' by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987), but considered to be part of the subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). Finally, the ammonic field which dips into the hilar region has been referred to as CA4 in the nomenclature of Lorente de No' (1934), but is considered to be the continuation of CA3 by Amaral and lnsausti (1990).\" (pp. 513, 514) \"The Presubiculum and Area 29a-c The presubiculum (area 27 of Brodmann, 1909) and parasubicuulum (area 49 of Brodmann, 1909) differ from the fields included in the hippocampal formation on structural grounds.

As shown in Figure 1, the presubiculum has a clearly delineated dense upper layer, and a less well-defined deep cellular layer invaded partly by the medial extension of the subiculum (see also Amaral and Insausti, 1990). The presubiculum gives way to the parasubiculum medially, which has a less densely packed external cellular layer than the presubiculum (Fig. 1A-C) and has a dense plexus of AChE in the upper layers (Fig. 2A, B).

Projections from the entorhinal cortex, which were included in cortical studies previously (e.g., Barbas, 1993), will not be considered here. Investigators generally agree on the borders of the various hippocampal fields, although there are some differences in the precise terminology used (for discussion, see Amaral, 1987; Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987). The minor differences encountered commonly in the modern literature will be pointed out briefly so that comparisons can be made among studies that use one or the other convention. Investigators who have adhered to the parceling of Lorente de No´(1934) have distinguished between an area called the prosubiculum and the subiculum (Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1987), whereas others consider the entire region to be part of the subiculum (Amaral and Insausti, 1990). In this report we have retained the designation prosubiculum because its borders are prominently defined by acetylcholinesterase (AChE; Fig. 2). Another difference centers on the term used for the rostral field, designated CA1' by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987), but considered to be part of the subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). Finally, the ammonic field which dips into the hilar region has been referred to as CA4 in the nomenclature of Lorente de No' (1934), but is considered to be the continuation of CA3 by Amaral and lnsausti (1990).\" (pp. 513, 514) \"The Presubiculum and Area 29a-c The presubiculum (area 27 of Brodmann, 1909) and parasubicuulum (area 49 of Brodmann, 1909) differ from the fields included in the hippocampal formation on structural grounds. As shown in Figure 1, the presubiculum has a clearly delineated dense upper layer, and a less well-defined deep cellular layer invaded partly by the medial extension of the subiculum (see also Amaral and Insausti, 1990). The presubiculum gives way to the parasubiculum medially, which has a less densely packed external cellular layer than the presubiculum (Fig. 1A-C) and has a dense plexus of AChE in the upper layers (Fig. 2A, B). The presubiculum is situated next to the subiculum and is readily recognizable near the subcallosal part of the subiculum. Stucturally the presubiculum resembles the dorsally situated area 29a-c. However, even though several investigators have recognized that a small part of the subiculum extends dorsally above the corpus callosum, the adjacent region has been designated area 29a-c (Vogt et al., 1987) and has been differentiated from the presubiculum situated below the corpus callosum. Our observations indicate that the presubiculum is topographically continuous with area 29a-c. In addition, we have noted a close strucutural relationship between the presubiculum and area 29a-c, as seen in Nissl sections taken from a level just before and immediately caudal to the splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig. 12). We entertain the possibility that the presubiuculum and area 29a-c may be the same area. In this section we will continue to distinguish the ventrally situated presubiculum from the dorsally situated area 29a-c according to convention, but with the above idea in mind.\" (pp. 519, 522, 524 )",

              "Citation": "\"Figure4.\r\nIn case AI, labeled neurons (black dots) seen after injection of fast blue (fb) in medial area 32/24 (A, black area) are depicted on a two-dimensional map where the hippocampal formation was unfolded (C) and in coronal sections (D-F) taken at the level indicated in C. Labeled neurons are seen in CA1´, CA1, prosubiculum, and subiculum. An injection of diamidino yellow in olfactory areas (Pir, OLF) on the basal surface  (B, dy) resulted in a few labeled neurons (circle outlines) in the hippocampal formation. An injection of rhodamine labeled latex micrpspheres in arae Pall/OLF (B, r) resulted in a few labeled neurons restricted to the subiculum (squares). The fast blue injection also resulted in a cluster of labled neurons in the parasubiculum (E). …\" (p. 519, description of figure 4)\r\n\"Topography of Labeled Neurons in the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nMost labeled neurons were found in the rostral half of the hippocampal formation. However, a few labeled neurons were noted along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation including the caudalmost part of the subiculum and CA1 (Fig. 11). Among hippocampal fields, CA1 included thehighest number of labeled neurons (41%), followed by the subiculum (25%) and a rostral field (20%) designated CA1´ by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987) or the rostral subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). The prosubiculum included 13% of all labeled neurons, and fewer than 0.5% were noted in the CA4 region. The ranking of the relative density of labeled neurons in the different hippocampal fields did not differ in cases with injections in medial orbital cortices. In contast, the few labeled neurons noted in cases with lateral prefrontal injections were restricted to the subicular fields.\r\nThe most notable difference in the topography of labeled neurons innervating merdial, when compared with orbital, areas was in their distribution along the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. In medial cases labeled neurons were noted in CA1 rostrally and shifted to the subicular fields caudally (Figs. 4, 6, 7). In contrast, in orbital cases labeled neurons retained a remarkably consistent distribution within the hippocampal formation, and the same relative position within a given field (Figs. 8-10). Consequently, in medial cases labeled neurons were noted in three to four hippocampal fields, whereas the band of labeled neurons projecting to orbital sites was more narrow and often involved one hippocampal field. The projection pattern did not appear to be related to the size of the injection.\" (p. 519)\r\n\"Depth of Labeled Neurons Within the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nIn all cases the labeled neurons were found in the intermediate or deep parts of the pyramidal cell layer and showed a consistent regional variation within the different hippocamapl fields. Most labeled neurons in CA1 (94%) were found in the deepest part of the field close to the white matter. In contrast, in the prosubiculum and subiculum the majority of labeled neurons (80% and 91%, respectively) were found in an intermediate zone, which was also the case for neurons taking origin in CA1´ (96%).\" (p. 519)\r\n\"…The denate gyrus and the hilar region, which are not involved in prefrontal cortical projections, are not involved in the two-dimensional map.\" (p. 513)",

However, a few labeled neurons were noted along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation including the caudalmost part of the subiculum and CA1 (Fig. 11). Among hippocampal fields, CA1 included thehighest number of labeled neurons (41%), followed by the subiculum (25%) and a rostral field (20%) designated CA1´ by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987) or the rostral subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). The prosubiculum included 13% of all labeled neurons, and fewer than 0.5% were noted in the CA4 region. The ranking of the relative density of labeled neurons in the different hippocampal fields did not differ in cases with injections in medial orbital cortices. In contast, the few labeled neurons noted in cases with lateral prefrontal injections were restricted to the subicular fields.\r\nThe most notable difference in the topography of labeled neurons innervating merdial, when compared with orbital, areas was in their distribution along the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. In medial cases labeled neurons were noted in CA1 rostrally and shifted to the subicular fields caudally (Figs. 4, 6, 7). In contrast, in orbital cases labeled neurons retained a remarkably consistent distribution within the hippocampal formation, and the same relative position within a given field (Figs. 8-10). Consequently, in medial cases labeled neurons were noted in three to four hippocampal fields, whereas the band of labeled neurons projecting to orbital sites was more narrow and often involved one hippocampal field. The projection pattern did not appear to be related to the size of the injection.\" (p. 519)\r\n\"Depth of Labeled Neurons Within the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nIn all cases the labeled neurons were found in the intermediate or deep parts of the pyramidal cell layer and showed a consistent regional variation within the different hippocamapl fields. Most labeled neurons in CA1 (94%) were found in the deepest part of the field close to the white matter. In contrast, in the prosubiculum and subiculum the majority of labeled neurons (80% and 91%, respectively) were found in an intermediate zone, which was also the case for neurons taking origin in CA1´ (96%).\" (p. 519)\r\n\"…The denate gyrus and the hilar region, which are not involved in prefrontal cortical projections, are not involved in the two-dimensional map.\" (p. 513)",

In recent studies these cases have been identified by the same codes (Barbas, 1993, 1995b; Dermon and Barbas, 1994), which also included the designations used in older studies. Two cases which have not been described in recent studies were denoted previously (Barbas and Mesulam, 1985) as case v (case SF here) and, in Barbas De Olmos (1990), as case 6 (case MAV here).\" (p. 514)\r\n\"Figure 3A is a composite of the injection sites on the medial (1), lateral (2), and basal (3) surfaces of the prefrontal cortex in all cases where positive neurons were noted in the hippocampal formation.

However, a few labeled neurons were noted along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation including the caudalmost part of the subiculum and CA1 (Fig. 11). Among hippocampal fields, CA1 included thehighest number of labeled neurons (41%), followed by the subiculum (25%) and a rostral field (20%) designated CA1´ by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987) or the rostral subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). The prosubiculum included 13% of all labeled neurons, and fewer than 0.5% were noted in the CA4 region. The ranking of the relative density of labeled neurons in the different hippocampal fields did not differ in cases with injections in medial orbital cortices. In contast, the few labeled neurons noted in cases with lateral prefrontal injections were restricted to the subicular fields.\r\nThe most notable difference in the topography of labeled neurons innervating merdial, when compared with orbital, areas was in their distribution along the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. In medial cases labeled neurons were noted in CA1 rostrally and shifted to the subicular fields caudally (Figs. 4, 6, 7). In contrast, in orbital cases labeled neurons retained a remarkably consistent distribution within the hippocampal formation, and the same relative position within a given field (Figs. 8-10). Consequently, in medial cases labeled neurons were noted in three to four hippocampal fields, whereas the band of labeled neurons projecting to orbital sites was more narrow and often involved one hippocampal field. The projection pattern did not appear to be related to the size of the injection.\" (p. 519)\r\n\"Depth of Labeled Neurons Within the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nIn all cases the labeled neurons were found in the intermediate or deep parts of the pyramidal cell layer and showed a consistent regional variation within the different hippocamapl fields. Most labeled neurons in CA1 (94%) were found in the deepest part of the field close to the white matter. In contrast, in the prosubiculum and subiculum the majority of labeled neurons (80% and 91%, respectively) were found in an intermediate zone, which was also the case for neurons taking origin in CA1´ (96%).\" (p. 519)\r\n\"…The denate gyrus and the hilar region, which are not involved in prefrontal cortical projections, are not involved in the two-dimensional map.\" (p. 513)",

However, a few labeled neurons were noted along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation including the caudalmost part of the subiculum and CA1 (Fig. 11). Among hippocampal fields, CA1 included thehighest number of labeled neurons (41%), followed by the subiculum (25%) and a rostral field (20%) designated CA1´ by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987) or the rostral subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). The prosubiculum included 13% of all labeled neurons, and fewer than 0.5% were noted in the CA4 region. The ranking of the relative density of labeled neurons in the different hippocampal fields did not differ in cases with injections in medial orbital cortices. In contast, the few labeled neurons noted in cases with lateral prefrontal injections were restricted to the subicular fields.\r\nThe most notable difference in the topography of labeled neurons innervating merdial, when compared with orbital, areas was in their distribution along the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. In medial cases labeled neurons were noted in CA1 rostrally and shifted to the subicular fields caudally (Figs. 4, 6, 7). In contrast, in orbital cases labeled neurons retained a remarkably consistent distribution within the hippocampal formation, and the same relative position within a given field (Figs. 8-10). Consequently, in medial cases labeled neurons were noted in three to four hippocampal fields, whereas the band of labeled neurons projecting to orbital sites was more narrow and often involved one hippocampal field. The projection pattern did not appear to be related to the size of the injection.\" (p. 519)\r\n\"Depth of Labeled Neurons Within the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nIn all cases the labeled neurons were found in the intermediate or deep parts of the pyramidal cell layer and showed a consistent regional variation within the different hippocamapl fields. Most labeled neurons in CA1 (94%) were found in the deepest part of the field close to the white matter. In contrast, in the prosubiculum and subiculum the majority of labeled neurons (80% and 91%, respectively) were found in an intermediate zone, which was also the case for neurons taking origin in CA1´ (96%).\" (p. 519)\r\n\"…The denate gyrus and the hilar region, which are not involved in prefrontal cortical projections, are not involved in the two-dimensional map.\" (p. 513)",

However, a few labeled neurons were noted along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation including the caudalmost part of the subiculum and CA1 (Fig. 11). Among hippocampal fields, CA1 included thehighest number of labeled neurons (41%), followed by the subiculum (25%) and a rostral field (20%) designated CA1´ by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987) or the rostral subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). The prosubiculum included 13% of all labeled neurons, and fewer than 0.5% were noted in the CA4 region. The ranking of the relative density of labeled neurons in the different hippocampal fields did not differ in cases with injections in medial orbital cortices. In contast, the few labeled neurons noted in cases with lateral prefrontal injections were restricted to the subicular fields.\r\nThe most notable difference in the topography of labeled neurons innervating merdial, when compared with orbital, areas was in their distribution along the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. In medial cases labeled neurons were noted in CA1 rostrally and shifted to the subicular fields caudally (Figs. 4, 6, 7). In contrast, in orbital cases labeled neurons retained a remarkably consistent distribution within the hippocampal formation, and the same relative position within a given field (Figs. 8-10). Consequently, in medial cases labeled neurons were noted in three to four hippocampal fields, whereas the band of labeled neurons projecting to orbital sites was more narrow and often involved one hippocampal field. The projection pattern did not appear to be related to the size of the injection.\" (p. 519)\r\n\"Depth of Labeled Neurons Within the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nIn all cases the labeled neurons were found in the intermediate or deep parts of the pyramidal cell layer and showed a consistent regional variation within the different hippocamapl fields. Most labeled neurons in CA1 (94%) were found in the deepest part of the field close to the white matter. In contrast, in the prosubiculum and subiculum the majority of labeled neurons (80% and 91%, respectively) were found in an intermediate zone, which was also the case for neurons taking origin in CA1´ (96%).\" (p. 519)\r\n\"…The denate gyrus and the hilar region, which are not involved in prefrontal cortical projections, are not involved in the two-dimensional map.\" (p. 513)",

However, a few labeled neurons were noted along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation including the caudalmost part of the subiculum and CA1 (Fig. 11). Among hippocampal fields, CA1 included thehighest number of labeled neurons (41%), followed by the subiculum (25%) and a rostral field (20%) designated CA1´ by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987) or the rostral subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). The prosubiculum included 13% of all labeled neurons, and fewer than 0.5% were noted in the CA4 region. The ranking of the relative density of labeled neurons in the different hippocampal fields did not differ in cases with injections in medial orbital cortices. In contast, the few labeled neurons noted in cases with lateral prefrontal injections were restricted to the subicular fields.\r\nThe most notable difference in the topography of labeled neurons innervating merdial, when compared with orbital, areas was in their distribution along the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. In medial cases labeled neurons were noted in CA1 rostrally and shifted to the subicular fields caudally (Figs. 4, 6, 7). In contrast, in orbital cases labeled neurons retained a remarkably consistent distribution within the hippocampal formation, and the same relative position within a given field (Figs. 8-10). Consequently, in medial cases labeled neurons were noted in three to four hippocampal fields, whereas the band of labeled neurons projecting to orbital sites was more narrow and often involved one hippocampal field. The projection pattern did not appear to be related to the size of the injection.\" (p. 519)\r\n\"Depth of Labeled Neurons Within the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nIn all cases the labeled neurons were found in the intermediate or deep parts of the pyramidal cell layer and showed a consistent regional variation within the different hippocamapl fields. Most labeled neurons in CA1 (94%) were found in the deepest part of the field close to the white matter. In contrast, in the prosubiculum and subiculum the majority of labeled neurons (80% and 91%, respectively) were found in an intermediate zone, which was also the case for neurons taking origin in CA1´ (96%).\" (p. 519)\r\n\"…The denate gyrus and the hilar region, which are not involved in prefrontal cortical projections, are not involved in the two-dimensional map.\" (p. 513)",

However, a few labeled neurons were noted along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation including the caudalmost part of the subiculum and CA1 (Fig. 11). Among hippocampal fields, CA1 included thehighest number of labeled neurons (41%), followed by the subiculum (25%) and a rostral field (20%) designated CA1´ by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987) or the rostral subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). The prosubiculum included 13% of all labeled neurons, and fewer than 0.5% were noted in the CA4 region. The ranking of the relative density of labeled neurons in the different hippocampal fields did not differ in cases with injections in medial orbital cortices. In contast, the few labeled neurons noted in cases with lateral prefrontal injections were restricted to the subicular fields.\r\nThe most notable difference in the topography of labeled neurons innervating merdial, when compared with orbital, areas was in their distribution along the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. In medial cases labeled neurons were noted in CA1 rostrally and shifted to the subicular fields caudally (Figs. 4, 6, 7). In contrast, in orbital cases labeled neurons retained a remarkably consistent distribution within the hippocampal formation, and the same relative position within a given field (Figs. 8-10). Consequently, in medial cases labeled neurons were noted in three to four hippocampal fields, whereas the band of labeled neurons projecting to orbital sites was more narrow and often involved one hippocampal field. The projection pattern did not appear to be related to the size of the injection.\" (p. 519)\r\n\"Depth of Labeled Neurons Within the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nIn all cases the labeled neurons were found in the intermediate or deep parts of the pyramidal cell layer and showed a consistent regional variation within the different hippocamapl fields. Most labeled neurons in CA1 (94%) were found in the deepest part of the field close to the white matter. In contrast, in the prosubiculum and subiculum the majority of labeled neurons (80% and 91%, respectively) were found in an intermediate zone, which was also the case for neurons taking origin in CA1´ (96%).\" (p. 519)\r\n\"…The denate gyrus and the hilar region, which are not involved in prefrontal cortical projections, are not involved in the two-dimensional map.\" (p. 513)",

However, a few labeled neurons were noted along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation including the caudalmost part of the subiculum and CA1 (Fig. 11). Among hippocampal fields, CA1 included thehighest number of labeled neurons (41%), followed by the subiculum (25%) and a rostral field (20%) designated CA1´ by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987) or the rostral subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). The prosubiculum included 13% of all labeled neurons, and fewer than 0.5% were noted in the CA4 region. The ranking of the relative density of labeled neurons in the different hippocampal fields did not differ in cases with injections in medial orbital cortices. In contast, the few labeled neurons noted in cases with lateral prefrontal injections were restricted to the subicular fields.\r\nThe most notable difference in the topography of labeled neurons innervating merdial, when compared with orbital, areas was in their distribution along the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. In medial cases labeled neurons were noted in CA1 rostrally and shifted to the subicular fields caudally (Figs. 4, 6, 7). In contrast, in orbital cases labeled neurons retained a remarkably consistent distribution within the hippocampal formation, and the same relative position within a given field (Figs. 8-10). Consequently, in medial cases labeled neurons were noted in three to four hippocampal fields, whereas the band of labeled neurons projecting to orbital sites was more narrow and often involved one hippocampal field. The projection pattern did not appear to be related to the size of the injection.\" (p. 519)\r\n\"Depth of Labeled Neurons Within the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nIn all cases the labeled neurons were found in the intermediate or deep parts of the pyramidal cell layer and showed a consistent regional variation within the different hippocamapl fields. Most labeled neurons in CA1 (94%) were found in the deepest part of the field close to the white matter. In contrast, in the prosubiculum and subiculum the majority of labeled neurons (80% and 91%, respectively) were found in an intermediate zone, which was also the case for neurons taking origin in CA1´ (96%).\" (p. 519)\r\n\"…The denate gyrus and the hilar region, which are not involved in prefrontal cortical projections, are not involved in the two-dimensional map.\" (p. 513)\r\n\"Negative Sites.\r\nThere was no evidence of labeled neurons in the hippocampal formation after injection of tracers in the caudal part of medial area 9, the caudal part of orbital area 12  (two cases), or an adjacent sector of area Pro (cases are not shown). As noted above, a few scattered labeled neurons were noted after injection of HRP in the rostral part of medial area 9 (case AO), the rostral part of area 12 (case MBY), or another sector of area Pro (case AF). Taken together, the above findings suggest that only a few, if any, afferent neurons from the hippocampal formation project to the laterally situated orbitofrontal cortices, including orbital area 12, area Pro and area Pall, or to medial area 9. In addition, there was no evidence of labeled neurons in the hippocampal formation following injection of HRP or fluorescent dyes in most lateral prefrontal sites including dorsal area 8 (five areas), the caudal part of area 46 (three cases), the central part of dorsal area 46 (one case), or lateral area 12 (one case).\" (p. 519)",

As noted above, a few scattered labeled neurons were noted after injection of HRP in the rostral part of medial area 9 (case AO), the rostral part of area 12 (case MBY), or another sector of area Pro (case AF). Taken together, the above findings suggest that only a few, if any, afferent neurons from the hippocampal formation project to the laterally situated orbitofrontal cortices, including orbital area 12, area Pro and area Pall, or to medial area 9. In addition, there was no evidence of labeled neurons in the hippocampal formation following injection of HRP or fluorescent dyes in most lateral prefrontal sites including dorsal area 8 (five areas), the caudal part of area 46 (three cases), the central part of dorsal area 46 (one case), or lateral area 12 (one case).\" (p. 519)",

Labeled neurons are seen in CA1´, CA1, prosubiculum, and subiculum. An injection of diamidino yellow in olfactory areas (Pir, OLF) on the basal surface  (B, dy) resulted in a few labeled neurons (circle outlines) in the hippocampal formation. An injection of rhodamine labeled latex micrpspheres in arae Pall/OLF (B, r) resulted in a few labeled neurons restricted to the subiculum (squares). The fast blue injection also resulted in a cluster of labled neurons in the parasubiculum (E). …\" (p. 519, description of figure 4)\r\n\"Topography of Labeled Neurons in the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nMost labeled neurons were found in the rostral half of the hippocampal formation. However, a few labeled neurons were noted along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation including the caudalmost part of the subiculum and CA1 (Fig. 11). Among hippocampal fields, CA1 included thehighest number of labeled neurons (41%), followed by the subiculum (25%) and a rostral field (20%) designated CA1´ by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987) or the rostral subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). The prosubiculum included 13% of all labeled neurons, and fewer than 0.5% were noted in the CA4 region. The ranking of the relative density of labeled neurons in the different hippocampal fields did not differ in cases with injections in medial orbital cortices. In contast, the few labeled neurons noted in cases with lateral prefrontal injections were restricted to the subicular fields.\r\nThe most notable difference in the topography of labeled neurons innervating merdial, when compared with orbital, areas was in their distribution along the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. In medial cases labeled neurons were noted in CA1 rostrally and shifted to the subicular fields caudally (Figs. 4, 6, 7). In contrast, in orbital cases labeled neurons retained a remarkably consistent distribution within the hippocampal formation, and the same relative position within a given field (Figs. 8-10). Consequently, in medial cases labeled neurons were noted in three to four hippocampal fields, whereas the band of labeled neurons projecting to orbital sites was more narrow and often involved one hippocampal field. The projection pattern did not appear to be related to the size of the injection.\" (p. 519)\r\n\"Depth of Labeled Neurons Within the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nIn all cases the labeled neurons were found in the intermediate or deep parts of the pyramidal cell layer and showed a consistent regional variation within the different hippocamapl fields. Most labeled neurons in CA1 (94%) were found in the deepest part of the field close to the white matter. In contrast, in the prosubiculum and subiculum the majority of labeled neurons (80% and 91%, respectively) were found in an intermediate zone, which was also the case for neurons taking origin in CA1´ (96%).\" (p. 519)\r\n\"…The denate gyrus and the hilar region, which are not involved in prefrontal cortical projections, are not involved in the two-dimensional map.\" (p. 513)",

Labeled neurons are seen in CA1´, CA1, prosubiculum, and subiculum. An injection of diamidino yellow in olfactory areas (Pir, OLF) on the basal surface  (B, dy) resulted in a few labeled neurons (circle outlines) in the hippocampal formation. An injection of rhodamine labeled latex micrpspheres in arae Pall/OLF (B, r) resulted in a few labeled neurons restricted to the subiculum (squares). The fast blue injection also resulted in a cluster of labled neurons in the parasubiculum (E). …\" (p. 519, description of figure 4)\r\n\"Topography of Labeled Neurons in the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nMost labeled neurons were found in the rostral half of the hippocampal formation. However, a few labeled neurons were noted along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation including the caudalmost part of the subiculum and CA1 (Fig. 11). Among hippocampal fields, CA1 included thehighest number of labeled neurons (41%), followed by the subiculum (25%) and a rostral field (20%) designated CA1´ by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987) or the rostral subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). The prosubiculum included 13% of all labeled neurons, and fewer than 0.5% were noted in the CA4 region. The ranking of the relative density of labeled neurons in the different hippocampal fields did not differ in cases with injections in medial orbital cortices. In contast, the few labeled neurons noted in cases with lateral prefrontal injections were restricted to the subicular fields.\r\nThe most notable difference in the topography of labeled neurons innervating merdial, when compared with orbital, areas was in their distribution along the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. In medial cases labeled neurons were noted in CA1 rostrally and shifted to the subicular fields caudally (Figs. 4, 6, 7). In contrast, in orbital cases labeled neurons retained a remarkably consistent distribution within the hippocampal formation, and the same relative position within a given field (Figs. 8-10). Consequently, in medial cases labeled neurons were noted in three to four hippocampal fields, whereas the band of labeled neurons projecting to orbital sites was more narrow and often involved one hippocampal field. The projection pattern did not appear to be related to the size of the injection.\" (p. 519)\r\n\"Depth of Labeled Neurons Within the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nIn all cases the labeled neurons were found in the intermediate or deep parts of the pyramidal cell layer and showed a consistent regional variation within the different hippocamapl fields. Most labeled neurons in CA1 (94%) were found in the deepest part of the field close to the white matter. In contrast, in the prosubiculum and subiculum the majority of labeled neurons (80% and 91%, respectively) were found in an intermediate zone, which was also the case for neurons taking origin in CA1´ (96%).\" (p. 519)\r\n\"…The denate gyrus and the hilar region, which are not involved in prefrontal cortical projections, are not involved in the two-dimensional map.\" (p. 513)",

In recent studies these cases have been identified by the same codes (Barbas, 1993, 1995b; Dermon and Barbas, 1994), which also included the designations used in older studies. Two cases which have not been described in recent studies were denoted previously (Barbas and Mesulam, 1985) as case v (case SF here) and, in Barbas De Olmos (1990), as case 6 (case MAV here).\" (p. 514)\r\n\"Figure 3A is a composite of the injection sites on the medial (1), lateral (2), and basal (3) surfaces of the prefrontal cortex in all cases where positive neurons were noted in the hippocampal formation.

However, a few labeled neurons were noted along the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation including the caudalmost part of the subiculum and CA1 (Fig. 11). Among hippocampal fields, CA1 included thehighest number of labeled neurons (41%), followed by the subiculum (25%) and a rostral field (20%) designated CA1´ by Rosene and Van Hoesen (1987) or the rostral subiculum by Amaral and Insausti (1990). The prosubiculum included 13% of all labeled neurons, and fewer than 0.5% were noted in the CA4 region. The ranking of the relative density of labeled neurons in the different hippocampal fields did not differ in cases with injections in medial orbital cortices. In contast, the few labeled neurons noted in cases with lateral prefrontal injections were restricted to the subicular fields.\r\nThe most notable difference in the topography of labeled neurons innervating merdial, when compared with orbital, areas was in their distribution along the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampus. In medial cases labeled neurons were noted in CA1 rostrally and shifted to the subicular fields caudally (Figs. 4, 6, 7). In contrast, in orbital cases labeled neurons retained a remarkably consistent distribution within the hippocampal formation, and the same relative position within a given field (Figs. 8-10). Consequently, in medial cases labeled neurons were noted in three to four hippocampal fields, whereas the band of labeled neurons projecting to orbital sites was more narrow and often involved one hippocampal field. The projection pattern did not appear to be related to the size of the injection.\" (p. 519)\r\n\"Depth of Labeled Neurons Within the Hippocampal Formation.\r\nIn all cases the labeled neurons were found in the intermediate or deep parts of the pyramidal cell layer and showed a consistent regional variation within the different hippocamapl fields. Most labeled neurons in CA1 (94%) were found in the deepest part of the field close to the white matter. In contrast, in the prosubiculum and subiculum the majority of labeled neurons (80% and 91%, respectively) were found in an intermediate zone, which was also the case for neurons taking origin in CA1´ (96%).\" (p. 519)\r\n\"…The denate gyrus and the hilar region, which are not involved in prefrontal cortical projections, are not involved in the two-dimensional map.\" (p. 513)",

    "title": "Topographically specific hippocampal projections target functionally distinct prefrontal areas in the rhesus monkey",
    "abstract": "The sources of ipsilateral projections from the hippocampal formation, the presubiculum, area 29a-c, and parasubiculum to medial, orbital, and lateral prefrontal cortices were studied with retrograde tracers in 27 rhesus monkeys. Labeled neurons within the hippocampal formation (CA1, CA1', prosubiculum, and subiculum) were found rostrally, although some were noted throughout the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation. Most labeled neurons in the hippocampal formation projected to medial prefrontal cortices, followed by orbital areas. In addition, there were differences in the topography of afferent neurons projecting to medial when compared with orbital cortices. Labeled neurons innervating medial cortices were found mainly in the CA1' and CA1 fields rostrally, but originated in the subicular fields caudally. In contrast, labeled neurons which innervated orbital cortices were considerably more focal, emanating from the same relative position within a field throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation. In marked contrast to the pattern of projection to medial and orbital prefrontal cortices, lateral prefrontal areas received projections from only a few labeled neurons found mostly in the subicular fields. Lateral prefrontal cortices received the most robust projections from the presubiculum and the supracallosal area 29a-c. Orbital, and to a lesser extent medial, prefrontal areas received projections from a smaller but significant number of neurons from the presubiculum and area 29a-c. Only a few labeled neurons were found in the parasubiculum, and most projected to medial prefrontal areas. The results suggest that functionally distinct prefrontal cortices receive projections from different components of the hippocampal region. Medial and orbital prefrontal cortices may have a role in long-term mnemonic processes similar to those associated with the hippocampal formation with which they are linked. Moreover, the preponderance of projection neurons from the hippocampal formation innervating medial when compared with orbital prefrontal areas followed the opposite trend from what we had observed previously for the amygdala (Barbas and De Olmos [1990] (J Comp Neurol 301:1-23). Thus, the hippocampal formation, associated with mnemonic processes, targets predominantly medial prefrontal cortices, whereas the amygdala, associated with emotional aspects of memory, issues robust projections to orbital limbic cortices. Lateral prefrontal cortices receive robust projections from the presubiculum and area 29a-c and sparse projections from the hippocampal formation. These findings are consistent with the idea that the role of lateral prefrontal cortices in memory is distinct from that of either medial or orbital cortices. The results suggest that signals from functionally distinct limbic structures to some extent follow parallel pathways to functionally distinct prefrontal cortices.",
