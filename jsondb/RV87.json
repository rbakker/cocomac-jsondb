Lorente de Nó (1934) designated these neurons as a CA4 subfield or modified Ammon's horn pyramids.On the basis of his Golgi study and other reports that indicated the hilar neurons were dominated by afferent input from the dentate gyrus, Amaral argued that the CA4 terminology of Lorente de Nó be discarded. As shown in Fig. 10A, the polymorphic neurons of the hilus of the rat dentate gyrus do appear to be homogeneously dispersed except for a small cluster of neurons (asterisk in Fig. 10A and 4A) near the tip of the pyramidal cell layer of the CA3 subfield. However, the hilar neurons in the monkey and man clearly form two distinct groups, a polymorphic layer and a prominent CA4 cluster (Figs. 4B, C and 10 B, C). In addition, our observations in the monkey indicate that only the polymorphic neurons give rise to the dentate gyrus association and commissural projection while the CA4 neurons project out of the hippocampal formation to the septal area. Consequently, we have retained the CA4 designation for the primate hippocampal formation.\" (p. 373)",

Proximal to the pyramidal cell layer, approximately the inner fifth of this plexiform layer is occupied by the \"mossy fibers\" that originate from the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. In Nissl-stained sections this layer can often be discerned as a clear area and is classically designated the stratum lucidum. As illustrated in Fig. 11, in the monkey the stratum lucidum also stands out as an AChE-poor zone and in the Timm's stain clearly corersponds to the distribution of the zinc-rich mossy fibers, so we simply label it the mossy fiber layer (mf). Immediately above the mossy fiber layer is the stratum radiatum, which occupies the next two-fifths of the plexiform layer and corresponds to the zone of termination of the Schaffer collaterals of the CA3 pyramidal cells. It is both AChE-positive and stains intensely with Timm's stain (Fig. 11). Finally, the outer two-fifths of this plexiform layer has been designated as the stratum lacunosum and stratum moleculare. For convenience, we refer to this as simply the stratum moleculare or the molecular layer and it corresponds to the zone of termination of extrinsic afferents from the entorhinal cortex (Van Hoesen and Pandya, 1975).

This latter area apparently corresponds to what we designate the CTA as well as the adjacent posterior part of the cortical amygdaloid nucleus [see Saunders and Rosene (1987) for additional illustrations]. In addition, our HATA is entirely on the \"hippocampal\" side of the area Price labels the amygdalohippocampal area. In Fig. 8A a potentially homologuous region in the uncal hippocampus of the hipppocampal formation is designated with an asterisk. While much more needs to be learned about the HATA, it is clearly a part of the hipppocampal formation in its location, histochemical characteristics, and connections but is so distinct from all the other hippocampal subfields that a separate designation is necessary. However, it is likely that as we discover more about this unique area, another more meaningful designation may be needed.\" (p. 386)",
      "Comments": "Although it is stated that stratum oriens and radiatum end at the transition to HATA, figure 17 show that HATA has both laminas not only at the transition from CA1´ to HATA but also through approximately the half of its extent.",

Lorente de Nó (1934) designated these neurons as a CA4 subfield or modified Ammon's horn pyramids.On the basis of his Golgi study and other reports that indicated the hilar neurons were dominated by afferent input from the dentate gyrus, Amaral argued that the CA4 terminology of Lorente de Nó be discarded. As shown in Fig. 10A, the polymorphic neurons of the hilus of the rat dentate gyrus do appear to be homogeneously dispersed except for a small cluster of neurons (asterisk in Fig. 10A and 4A) near the tip of the pyramidal cell layer of the CA3 subfield. However, the hilar neurons in the monkey and man clearly form two distinct groups, a polymorphic layer and a prominent CA4 cluster (Figs. 4B, C and 10 B, C). In addition, our observations in the monkey indicate that only the polymorphic neurons give rise to the dentate gyrus association and commissural projection while the CA4 neurons project out of the hippocampal formation to the septal area. Consequently, we have retained the CA4 designation for the primate hippocampal formation.\" (p. 373)",

Theses two subfields are dorsomedially adjacent to the most rostral part of CA2 and rostrally they reach the medial surface of the uncus between the entorhinal cortex (ventrally) and the CTA dorsally as shown in Fig. 9A (also Fig. 7A a bit farther rostrally). Because of the unique features of theses two areas, they deserve a more complete discussion. The dorsomedial CA1´subfield: In the most anteromedial part of the genu, subfield CA2 is readily distinguished by its densely chromophilic neurons and the absence of the dentate gyrus mossy fibers and the corresponding stratum lucidum. At levels anterior to Fig. 7A, it is clear that this medial CA2 subfield is continuous with the lateral CA2 subfield and simply constitutes the dorsomedial curvature of the CA2 subfield slightly rostral to CA3. However, throughout the genu the medial border of this dorsomedial CA2 subfield abuts a subfield that topographically should correspond to the CA1 subfield but architectonically is quite different as shown in Figs. 9C, D and 14-16. Nevertheless, this subfield shares some of the characteristics of the CA1 subfield so we have retained the CA1 designation but acknowledged the many differences by referring to it as CA1´.\" (p. 383)",
