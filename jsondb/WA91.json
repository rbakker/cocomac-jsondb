  "Title": "Entorhinal cortex of the monkey: V. Projections to the dentate gyrus, hippocampus, and subicular complex",
  "Abstract": "The topographic and laminar organization of entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus, hippocampus, and subicular complex was investigated in the Macaca fascicularis monkey. Injections of 3H-amino acids were placed at various positions within the entorhinal cortex and the distribution of anterogradely labeled fibers and terminals within the other fields of the hippocampal formation was determined. Injections of the retrograde tracers Fast blue, Diamidino yellow, and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were also placed into the dentate gyrus, hippocampus, and subicular complex, and the distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in the entorhinal cortex was plotted using a computer-aided digitizing system. The entorhinal cortex gave rise to projections that terminated in the subiculum, in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 fields of the hippocampus, and in the dentate gyrus. Projections to the dentate gyrus, and fields CA3 and CA2 of the hippocampus, originated preferentially in layers II and VI of the entorhinal cortex whereas projections to CA1 and to the subiculum originated mainly in layers III and V. Anterograde tracing experiments demonstrated that all regions of the entorhinal cortex project to the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and to much of the radial extent of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA3 and CA2. While the terminal distributions of entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA2 were not as clearly laminated as in the rat, projections from rostral levels of the entorhinal cortex preferentially innervated the outer portion of the molecular layer and stratum lacunosum-moleculare, whereas more caudal levels of the entorhinal cortex projected relatively more heavily to the deeper portions of the entorhinal terminal zones. The entorhinal projection to the CA1 field of the hippocampus and to the subiculum followed a transverse rather than radial gradient of distribution. Rostral levels of the entorhinal cortex terminated most heavily at the border of CA1 and the subiculum. More caudal levels of the entorhinal cortex projected to progressively more distal portions of the subiculum (towards the presubiculum) and more proximal portions of CA1 (towards CA2). Lateral portions of the entorhinal cortex projected to caudal levels of the recipient fields and more medial parts of the entorhinal cortex projected to progressively more rostral portions of the fields.",

In three additional monkeys, two or three separate injections of retrograde tarcers [the fluorescent dyes and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP)] were placed ipsilaterallly at different levels of the hippocampal formation. In the remaining experiments, animals received single injections of either HRP, WGA-HRP, or one of the fluorescent tracers.

In five experimental animals, injections were placed bilaterally and two fluorescent tracers (Fats blue and Diamidino yellow) were injected at different rostrocaudal levels on each side. In three additional monkeys, two or three separate injections of retrograde tarcers [the fluorescent dyes and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP)] were placed ipsilaterallly at different levels of the hippocampal formation. In the remaining experiments, animals received single injections of either HRP, WGA-HRP, or one of the fluorescent tracers. In total, these experiments yielded 33 injection sites of which 20 proved useful for these studies.\" (p. 438)\r\nAs you can see, the text doesn't say which cases belong to the animals, which received bilateral injections. Because of that it is not possible for us to compare the results derived from animals with unilateral injections with the results derived from animals with bilateral injections.",

In the dentate gyrus and CA3 and CA2 fields of the hippocampus, labeled fibers and terminals were observed throughout the full transverse extents of the terminal fields in each case but the density of termination along the radial axis differed depending on the injection site.

All 3H-amino acid injections in the entorhinal cortex resulted in labeling of the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus , the full radial width of stratum lacunosum-moleculare fo all subfields of the hippocampus, and the outer two-thirds to three-quarters of the molecular layer of the subiculum. In the dentate gyrus and CA3 and CA2 fields of the hippocampus, labeled fibers and terminals were observed throughout the full transverse extents of the terminal fields in each case but the density of termination along the radial axis differed depending on the injection site. In CA1 and the subiculum, in contrast, the terminal field always had a restricted transverse distribution but was more or less evenly labeled throughout the entire radial width of the entorhinal synaptic region. \r\nFollowing all injections, weak labeling was present in the molecular layer and layer II of the pre-and parasubiculum; the parasubiculum was slightly more densely labeled. As noted above, it was extremely difficult to determine whether this light labeling in the pre-and parasubiculum represented terminal labeling or was exclusively associated with fibers of passage. We shall not comment further on the distribution of label in these fields. In most experimental cases, the hilus of the dentate gyrus also appeared to have labeling that was slightly above background levels. We should note that injections that gave rise to labeled projections to caudal levels of the ipsilateral hippocampal formation also labeled commissural fibers that terninated in caudal levels of the contralateral hippocampal formation. The contralateral projection was very weak and mainly directed to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus; additional, though very weak, labeling was also present in the hippocampus (Amaral et al., '84; Witter et al., '89b).\" (p. 445)",

In the dentate gyrus and CA3 and CA2 fields of the hippocampus, labeled fibers and terminals were observed throughout the full transverse extents of the terminal fields in each case but the density of termination along the radial axis differed depending on the injection site. In CA1 and the subiculum, in contrast, the terminal field always had a restricted transverse distribution but was more or less evenly labeled throughout the entire radial width of the entorhinal synaptic region. \r\nFollowing all injections, weak labeling was present in the molecular layer and layer II of the pre-and parasubiculum; the parasubiculum was slightly more densely labeled. As noted above, it was extremely difficult to determine whether this light labeling in the pre-and parasubiculum represented terminal labeling or was exclusively associated with fibers of passage. We shall not comment further on the distribution of label in these fields. In most experimental cases, the hilus of the dentate gyrus also appeared to have labeling that was slightly above background levels. We should note that injections that gave rise to labeled projections to caudal levels of the ipsilateral hippocampal formation also labeled commissural fibers that terninated in caudal levels of the contralateral hippocampal formation. The contralateral projection was very weak and mainly directed to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus; additional, though very weak, labeling was also present in the hippocampus (Amaral et al., '84; Witter et al., '89b).\" (p. 445)",

All 3H-amino acid injections in the entorhinal cortex resulted in labeling of the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus , the full radial width of stratum lacunosum-moleculare fo all subfields of the hippocampus, and the outer two-thirds to three-quarters of the molecular layer of the subiculum. In the dentate gyrus and CA3 and CA2 fields of the hippocampus, labeled fibers and terminals were observed throughout the full transverse extents of the terminal fields in each case but the density of termination along the radial axis differed depending on the injection site. In CA1 and the subiculum, in contrast, the terminal field always had a restricted transverse distribution but was more or less evenly labeled throughout the entire radial width of the entorhinal synaptic region. \r\nFollowing all injections, weak labeling was present in the molecular layer and layer II of the pre-and parasubiculum; the parasubiculum was slightly more densely labeled. As noted above, it was extremely difficult to determine whether this light labeling in the pre-and parasubiculum represented terminal labeling or was exclusively associated with fibers of passage. We shall not comment further on the distribution of label in these fields. In most experimental cases, the hilus of the dentate gyrus also appeared to have labeling that was slightly above background levels. We should note that injections that gave rise to labeled projections to caudal levels of the ipsilateral hippocampal formation also labeled commissural fibers that terninated in caudal levels of the contralateral hippocampal formation. The contralateral projection was very weak and mainly directed to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus; additional, though very weak, labeling was also present in the hippocampus (Amaral et al., '84; Witter et al., '89b).\" (p. 445)",

In five experimental animals, injections were placed bilaterally and two fluorescent tracers (Fats blue and Diamidino yellow) were injected at different rostrocaudal levels on each side. In three additional monkeys, two or three separate injections of retrograde tarcers [the fluorescent dyes and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP)] were placed ipsilaterallly at different levels of the hippocampal formation. In the remaining experiments, animals received single injections of either HRP, WGA-HRP, or one of the fluorescent tracers. In total, these experiments yielded 33 injection sites of which 20 proved useful for these studies.\" (p. 438)\r\nAs you can see, the text doesn't say which cases belong to the animals, which received bilateral injections.

    "abstract": "The topographic and laminar organization of entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus, hippocampus, and subicular complex was investigated in the Macaca fascicularis monkey. Injections of 3H-amino acids were placed at various positions within the entorhinal cortex and the distribution of anterogradely labeled fibers and terminals within the other fields of the hippocampal formation was determined. Injections of the retrograde tracers Fast blue, Diamidino yellow, and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were also placed into the dentate gyrus, hippocampus, and subicular complex, and the distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in the entorhinal cortex was plotted using a computer-aided digitizing system. The entorhinal cortex gave rise to projections that terminated in the subiculum, in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 fields of the hippocampus, and in the dentate gyrus. Projections to the dentate gyrus, and fields CA3 and CA2 of the hippocampus, originated preferentially in layers II and VI of the entorhinal cortex whereas projections to CA1 and to the subiculum originated mainly in layers III and V. Anterograde tracing experiments demonstrated that all regions of the entorhinal cortex project to the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and to much of the radial extent of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA3 and CA2. While the terminal distributions of entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA2 were not as clearly laminated as in the rat, projections from rostral levels of the entorhinal cortex preferentially innervated the outer portion of the molecular layer and stratum lacunosum-moleculare, whereas more caudal levels of the entorhinal cortex projected relatively more heavily to the deeper portions of the entorhinal terminal zones. The entorhinal projection to the CA1 field of the hippocampus and to the subiculum followed a transverse rather than radial gradient of distribution. Rostral levels of the entorhinal cortex terminated most heavily at the border of CA1 and the subiculum. More caudal levels of the entorhinal cortex projected to progressively more distal portions of the subiculum (towards the presubiculum) and more proximal portions of CA1 (towards CA2). Lateral portions of the entorhinal cortex projected to caudal levels of the recipient fields and more medial parts of the entorhinal cortex projected to progressively more rostral portions of the fields.",
