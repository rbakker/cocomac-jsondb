  "Title": "Dual pathways connecting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the hippocampal formation in the rhesus monkey",
  "Abstract": "Anterograde and retrograde tracing methods including autoradiography, horseradish peroxidase histochemistry and fluorescent dye transport were used to demonstrate that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is connected with the hippocampal formation and associated cortical regions by two distinct pathways. Fibers forming a lateral pathway travel in the fronto-occipital fasciculus and connect the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the fundus of the rhinal sulcus, posterior subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus, and the presubiculum. A larger medial pathway forms in the cingulum bundle and terminates in the most caudal part of the presubiculum, as well as in adjacent transitional cortices. These cortices form a caudomedial promontory that is located between the posterior cingulate and prestriate areas. In all allo- and mesocortical targets of prefrontal cortex, labeled terminals form banding patterns reminiscent of the columnar organization of afferent fiber columns in neocortex. The same cytoarchitectonic areas that receive prefrontal afferents issue reciprocal projections. The largest source is the caudomedial lobule including its presubicular portion. Neurons in the parahippocampal gyrus and adjacent presubiculum also are retrogradely labeled following implants of horseradish peroxidase or injection of fluorescent dyes into prefrontal cortex. In addition, subicular neurons project to the prefrontal cortex although the subiculum does not appear to receive prefrontal afferent input. These findings emphasize that multiple channels of communication link the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus via the parahippocampal gyrus, subiculum, presubiculum and adjacent transitional cortices. We speculate that each of these prefrontal projections may carry highly specific information into the hippocampus, whereas the reciprocal projections may allow retrieval by prefrontal cortex of memories stored in the hippocampus.",

Densely packed fascicles of labeled axons could be traced medially within the cingulum bundle (Figs. 6 and 7A) and laterally in the white matter between the putamen and orbitofrontal cortex (Figs 6 and 7B). The lateral bundle of axons was traced into the temporal lobe between the base of the claustrum and the amygdala at rostral level of the lobe  and could be followed caudally throughout the white matter adjacent to the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle (Figs. 6 and 7C). Labeled axons were observed in the most lateral aspect of the white matter deep to area 28 and also were present in the white matter dorsal to the cortex forming the posterior parahippocampal gyrus(Figs. 6 and 7D). Subjacent to areas TH and TF, labeled fibers extended medially and were continuous with the labeled core of white matter within the presubicular promontory (Figs. 6 and 7D).\r\nFollowing the fiber in the lateral pathway to their terminations, we observed prefrontal terminals in three major subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus (Fig. 8). Terminal labeling was most pronounced in the deeper layers of the medial bank of the rhinal sulcus (area 28) and also in the perirhinal cortex of the lateral bank (area 35) (Figs. 8A and 9A).Labeled fibers were also present in the white matter underlying area 28 proper and formed \"columns\" of terminal labeling far laterally in area 28 (Fig. 9A). Caudal to the rhinal fissure , columns of terminalsl labeling were also present in areas TH (Fig. 8B) and TF (Figs. 8C and 9C) whereas caudally in area TF, terminal labeling was restriced largely to layer I (Fig. 8C). It is noteworthy that labeled terminals were located superficially along the lateral bank of the occipitotemporal sulcus as well, although this area (TE) is situated outside the parahippocampal gyrus (Figs. 8B, 8D and 9C).\r\nAnalyses of the reciprocal connections from the parahippocampal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex in monkeys either injected with fluorescent dyes or implanted with HRP pellets in Brodmann 's area 9 revealed a consistent pattern and topography of neuronal labeling (Fig. 10). In anterior portions of the parhippocampal gyrus (area 28), only small numbers of labeled neurons were observed in the fundus of the rhinal sulcus in the transition area between areas 35 and 28 (Figs. 10A and 11B). Medially, the number of labeled neurons in the rhinal sulcus decreased markedly, and a few if any were found in area 28 proper. In more caudal coronal sections through the parahippocampal gyrus, the largest number of labeled cells was observed  near the occipitotemporal sulcus in area TF. The incidence of labeled cells was sharply lower in area TH (Fig. 10).\r\nThe laminar distribution of labeled neurons differed in each of the three parahippocampal areas examined. In area 28, HRP-reactive or fluorescently labeled cells were small to medium-sized pyramidal neurons concentrated in layer 4, although a few neurons were observed in layers 5, 6 and in the lower half of layer 3 (Fig. 11B). In area TH, labeled pyramidal neurons were sparsely distributed and were largely restricted to infragranular layers 5 and 6 with an occasional labeled neuron noted in layer 3 (Fig. 12A). In contrast, in area TF, near the occipitotemporal sulcus, many cells were found in layer 3 as well as in layers 5 and 6 (Fig 12B).\" (pp. 735, 737)\r\n\"Dorsal prefrontal connections with subicular, presubicular and transitional cortices\r\nIn all cases in which HRP or tritiated amino acids were injected into the cortex lining the PS, labeled axons could be traced throughout the medial pathway as it traveled within the cingulum bundle above the body of the corpus callosum and coursed around the splenium of the callsoum into the occipital lobe.Here, the prefrontal axons descended almost perpendicularly to the dorsal surface to reach the territory of the caudomedial lobule and the hippocampal formation. In both autoradiographic and HRP-reacted brains, terminal labeling was located in the molecular layer of the presubiculum (Figs. 8B and C). An interesting feature of the prefronto-presubicular terminal distribution in coronal sections was its disjunctive pattern, in which the terminals formed two discrete bands, 250-400 micrometer wide, that were separated and bordered by cell-free spaces (Fig. 13). This configuration could be followed in sequential sections and was reminiscent of ocular dominace stripes (Figs. 13A and C). Prefrontal terminals were never observed in the subiculum and, in fact, the junction of subiculum and presubiculum was sharply defined by the presence of prefrontal terminals in the latter. Within the presubiculum, a rostro-caudal gradient of prefrontal terminals was apparent with sparse terminal label at its most rostral levels and denser terminal labeling throughout the middle and caudal regions of this structure.\r\nBy far the most massive projection observed in this study was from the prefrontal cortex to the caudomedial lobule where fibers from the cingulum bundle swept into the core of the lobule (Figs. 8D and 14D-F). Terminals were distributed primarily in the deep layer and in the superficial cell-free layer of the caudomedial lobule, with only patchy terminal labeling observed between these two densely labeled lamina (Fig. 14D). At caudal levels labeled fibers formed columns extending throughout all cellular layers of the lobule (Figs. 14E and f). It is unclear whether this labeling represents terminal arborization of prefrontal afferents or fibers passing from the white matter core of the lobule to the outer-most layer. As in presubicular cortex, terminal labeling within the superficial layer exhibited spatial discontinuity.\r\nEvidence of reciprocal projections to prefrontal cortex were present in the cases with HRP implants or dye injections. At the level of the lateral geniculate ncucleus and the occipitotemporal  sulcus, scattered labeled neurons were found in the deep cell layer of the presubiculum and in the pyramidal layer in the medial third of this structure of the subiculum (Figs. 10B and C). Caudal to the lateral geniculate nucleus, the density labeled cells in the parahippocampal gyrus diminished greatly, and sections were frequently surveyed in which no labeled neurons were found. However, further caudally, in the caudomedial lobule, the density of labeled presubicular pyramidal cells exceeded that within any other region of the hippocampal formation (Figs. 10D, 15 and 16). Retrogradely labeled neurons were also preesnt in high density in th etransition cortex forming the ventrmedial wall of the lobul, where they assumed a bi-laminar configuration (Figs. 10D, 16A and C). (pp. 737-738)e underlying white matter where they diverged into two pathways. Densely packed fascicles of labeled axons could be traced medially within the cingulum bundle (Figs. 6 and 7A) and laterally in the white matter between the putamen and orbitofrontal cortex (Figs 6 and 7B). The lateral bundle of axons was traced into the temporal lobe between the base of the claustrum and the amygdala at rostral level of the lobe  and could be followed caudally throughout the white matter adjacent to the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle (Figs. 6 and 7C). Labeled axons were observed in the most lateral aspect of the white matter deep to area 28 and also were present in the white matter dorsal to the cortex forming the posterior parahippocampal gyrus(Figs. 6 and 7D). Subjacent to areas TH and TF, labeled fibers extended medially and were continuous with the labeled core of white matter within the presubicular promontory (Figs. 6 and 7D).\r\nFollowing the fiber in the lateral pathway to their terminations, we observed prefrontal terminals in three major subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus (Fig. 8). Terminal labeling was most pronounced in the deeper layers of the medial bank of the rhinal sulcus (area 28) and also in the perirhinal cortex of the lateral bank (area 35) (Figs. 8A and 9A).Labeled fibers were also present in the white matter underlying area 28 proper and formed \"columns\" of terminal labeling far laterally in area 28 (Fig. 9A). Caudal to the rhinal fissure , columns of terminalsl labeling were also present in areas TH (Fig. 8B) and TF (Figs. 8C and 9C) whereas caudally in area TF, terminal labeling was restriced largely to layer I (Fig. 8C). It is noteworthy that labeled terminals were located superficially along the lateral bank of the occipitotemporal sulcus as well, although this area (TE) is situated outside the parahippocampal gyrus (Figs. 8B, 8D and 9C).\r\nAnalyses of the reciprocal connections from the parahippocampal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex in monkeys either injected with fluorescent dyes or implanted with HRP pellets in Brodmann 's area 9 revealed a consistent pattern and topography of neuronal labeling (Fig. 10). In anterior portions of the parhippocampal gyrus (area 28), only small numbers of labeled neurons were observed in the fundus of the rhinal sulcus in the transition area between areas 35 and 28 (Figs. 10A and 11B). Medially, the number of labeled neurons in the rhinal sulcus decreased markedly, and a few if any were found in area 28 proper.

Subjacent to areas TH and TF, labeled fibers extended medially and were continuous with the labeled core of white matter within the presubicular promontory (Figs. 6 and 7D).\r\nFollowing the fiber in the lateral pathway to their terminations, we observed prefrontal terminals in three major subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus (Fig. 8). Terminal labeling was most pronounced in the deeper layers of the medial bank of the rhinal sulcus (area 28) and also in the perirhinal cortex of the lateral bank (area 35) (Figs. 8A and 9A).Labeled fibers were also present in the white matter underlying area 28 proper and formed \"columns\" of terminal labeling far laterally in area 28 (Fig. 9A). Caudal to the rhinal fissure , columns of terminalsl labeling were also present in areas TH (Fig. 8B) and TF (Figs. 8C and 9C) whereas caudally in area TF, terminal labeling was restriced largely to layer I (Fig. 8C). It is noteworthy that labeled terminals were located superficially along the lateral bank of the occipitotemporal sulcus as well, although this area (TE) is situated outside the parahippocampal gyrus (Figs. 8B, 8D and 9C).\r\nAnalyses of the reciprocal connections from the parahippocampal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex in monkeys either injected with fluorescent dyes or implanted with HRP pellets in Brodmann 's area 9 revealed a consistent pattern and topography of neuronal labeling (Fig. 10). In anterior portions of the parhippocampal gyrus (area 28), only small numbers of labeled neurons were observed in the fundus of the rhinal sulcus in the transition area between areas 35 and 28 (Figs. 10A and 11B). Medially, the number of labeled neurons in the rhinal sulcus decreased markedly, and a few if any were found in area 28 proper. In more caudal coronal sections through the parahippocampal gyrus, the largest number of labeled cells was observed  near the occipitotemporal sulcus in area TF. The incidence of labeled cells was sharply lower in area TH (Fig. 10).\r\nThe laminar distribution of labeled neurons differed in each of the three parahippocampal areas examined. In area 28, HRP-reactive or fluorescently labeled cells were small to medium-sized pyramidal neurons concentrated in layer 4, although a few neurons were observed in layers 5, 6 and in the lower half of layer 3 (Fig. 11B). In area TH, labeled pyramidal neurons were sparsely distributed and were largely restricted to infragranular layers 5 and 6 with an occasional labeled neuron noted in layer 3 (Fig. 12A). In contrast, in area TF, near the occipitotemporal sulcus, many cells were found in layer 3 as well as in layers 5 and 6 (Fig 12B).\" (pp. 735, 737)\r\n\"Dorsal prefrontal connections with subicular, presubicular and transitional cortices\r\nIn all cases in which HRP or tritiated amino acids were injected into the cortex lining the PS, labeled axons could be traced throughout the medial pathway as it traveled within the cingulum bundle above the body of the corpus callosum and coursed around the splenium of the callsoum into the occipital lobe.Here, the prefrontal axons descended almost perpendicularly to the dorsal surface to reach the territory of the caudomedial lobule and the hippocampal formation. In both autoradiographic and HRP-reacted brains, terminal labeling was located in the molecular layer of the presubiculum (Figs. 8B and C). An interesting feature of the prefronto-presubicular terminal distribution in coronal sections was its disjunctive pattern, in which the terminals formed two discrete bands, 250-400 micrometer wide, that were separated and bordered by cell-free spaces (Fig. 13). This configuration could be followed in sequential sections and was reminiscent of ocular dominace stripes (Figs. 13A and C). Prefrontal terminals were never observed in the subiculum and, in fact, the junction of subiculum and presubiculum was sharply defined by the presence of prefrontal terminals in the latter. Within the presubiculum, a rostro-caudal gradient of prefrontal terminals was apparent with sparse terminal label at its most rostral levels and denser terminal labeling throughout the middle and caudal regions of this structure.\r\nBy far the most massive projection observed in this study was from the prefrontal cortex to the caudomedial lobule where fibers from the cingulum bundle swept into the core of the lobule (Figs. 8D and 14D-F). Terminals were distributed primarily in the deep layer and in the superficial cell-free layer of the caudomedial lobule, with only patchy terminal labeling observed between these two densely labeled lamina (Fig. 14D). At caudal levels labeled fibers formed columns extending throughout all cellular layers of the lobule (Figs. 14E and f). It is unclear whether this labeling represents terminal arborization of prefrontal afferents or fibers passing from the white matter core of the lobule to the outer-most layer. As in presubicular cortex, terminal labeling within the superficial layer exhibited spatial discontinuity.\r\nEvidence of reciprocal projections to prefrontal cortex were present in the cases with HRP implants or dye injections. At the level of the lateral geniculate ncucleus and the occipitotemporal  sulcus, scattered labeled neurons were found in the deep cell layer of the presubiculum and in the pyramidal layer in the medial third of this structure of the subiculum (Figs. 10B and C). Caudal to the lateral geniculate nucleus, the density labeled cells in the parahippocampal gyrus diminished greatly, and sections were frequently surveyed in which no labeled neurons were found. However, further caudally, in the caudomedial lobule, the density of labeled presubicular pyramidal cells exceeded that within any other region of the hippocampal formation (Figs. 10D, 15 and 16). Retrogradely labeled neurons were also preesnt in high density in th etransition cortex forming the ventrmedial wall of the lobul, where they assumed a bi-laminar configuration (Figs. 10D, 16A and C).

Caudal to the lateral geniculate nucleus, the density labeled cells in the parahippocampal gyrus diminished greatly, and sections were frequently surveyed in which no labeled neurons were found. However, further caudally, in the caudomedial lobule, the density of labeled presubicular pyramidal cells exceeded that within any other region of the hippocampal formation (Figs. 10D, 15 and 16).

Densely packed fascicles of labeled axons could be traced medially within the cingulum bundle (Figs. 6 and 7A) and laterally in the white matter between the putamen and orbitofrontal cortex (Figs 6 and 7B). The lateral bundle of axons was traced into the temporal lobe between the base of the claustrum and the amygdala at rostral level of the lobe  and could be followed caudally throughout the white matter adjacent to the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle (Figs. 6 and 7C). Labeled axons were observed in the most lateral aspect of the white matter deep to area 28 and also were present in the white matter dorsal to the cortex forming the posterior parahippocampal gyrus(Figs. 6 and 7D). Subjacent to areas TH and TF, labeled fibers extended medially and were continuous with the labeled core of white matter within the presubicular promontory (Figs. 6 and 7D).\r\nFollowing the fiber in the lateral pathway to their terminations, we observed prefrontal terminals in three major subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus (Fig. 8). Terminal labeling was most pronounced in the deeper layers of the medial bank of the rhinal sulcus (area 28) and also in the perirhinal cortex of the lateral bank (area 35) (Figs. 8A and 9A).Labeled fibers were also present in the white matter underlying area 28 proper and formed \"columns\" of terminal labeling far laterally in area 28 (Fig. 9A). Caudal to the rhinal fissure , columns of terminalsl labeling were also present in areas TH (Fig. 8B) and TF (Figs. 8C and 9C) whereas caudally in area TF, terminal labeling was restriced largely to layer I (Fig. 8C). It is noteworthy that labeled terminals were located superficially along the lateral bank of the occipitotemporal sulcus as well, although this area (TE) is situated outside the parahippocampal gyrus (Figs. 8B, 8D and 9C).\r\nAnalyses of the reciprocal connections from the parahippocampal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex in monkeys either injected with fluorescent dyes or implanted with HRP pellets in Brodmann 's area 9 revealed a consistent pattern and topography of neuronal labeling (Fig. 10). In anterior portions of the parhippocampal gyrus (area 28), only small numbers of labeled neurons were observed in the fundus of the rhinal sulcus in the transition area between areas 35 and 28 (Figs. 10A and 11B). Medially, the number of labeled neurons in the rhinal sulcus decreased markedly, and a few if any were found in area 28 proper. In more caudal coronal sections through the parahippocampal gyrus, the largest number of labeled cells was observed  near the occipitotemporal sulcus in area TF. The incidence of labeled cells was sharply lower in area TH (Fig. 10).\r\nThe laminar distribution of labeled neurons differed in each of the three parahippocampal areas examined. In area 28, HRP-reactive or fluorescently labeled cells were small to medium-sized pyramidal neurons concentrated in layer 4, although a few neurons were observed in layers 5, 6 and in the lower half of layer 3 (Fig. 11B). In area TH, labeled pyramidal neurons were sparsely distributed and were largely restricted to infragranular layers 5 and 6 with an occasional labeled neuron noted in layer 3 (Fig. 12A). In contrast, in area TF, near the occipitotemporal sulcus, many cells were found in layer 3 as well as in layers 5 and 6 (Fig 12B).\" (pp. 735, 737)\r\n\"Dorsal prefrontal connections with subicular, presubicular and transitional cortices\r\nIn all cases in which HRP or tritiated amino acids were injected into the cortex lining the PS, labeled axons could be traced throughout the medial pathway as it traveled within the cingulum bundle above the body of the corpus callosum and coursed around the splenium of the callsoum into the occipital lobe.Here, the prefrontal axons descended almost perpendicularly to the dorsal surface to reach the territory of the caudomedial lobule and the hippocampal formation. In both autoradiographic and HRP-reacted brains, terminal labeling was located in the molecular layer of the presubiculum (Figs. 8B and C). An interesting feature of the prefronto-presubicular terminal distribution in coronal sections was its disjunctive pattern, in which the terminals formed two discrete bands, 250-400 micrometer wide, that were separated and bordered by cell-free spaces (Fig. 13).

Subjacent to areas TH and TF, labeled fibers extended medially and were continuous with the labeled core of white matter within the presubicular promontory (Figs. 6 and 7D).\r\nFollowing the fiber in the lateral pathway to their terminations, we observed prefrontal terminals in three major subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus (Fig. 8). Terminal labeling was most pronounced in the deeper layers of the medial bank of the rhinal sulcus (area 28) and also in the perirhinal cortex of the lateral bank (area 35) (Figs. 8A and 9A).Labeled fibers were also present in the white matter underlying area 28 proper and formed \"columns\" of terminal labeling far laterally in area 28 (Fig. 9A). Caudal to the rhinal fissure , columns of terminalsl labeling were also present in areas TH (Fig. 8B) and TF (Figs. 8C and 9C) whereas caudally in area TF, terminal labeling was restriced largely to layer I (Fig. 8C). It is noteworthy that labeled terminals were located superficially along the lateral bank of the occipitotemporal sulcus as well, although this area (TE) is situated outside the parahippocampal gyrus (Figs. 8B, 8D and 9C).\r\nAnalyses of the reciprocal connections from the parahippocampal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex in monkeys either injected with fluorescent dyes or implanted with HRP pellets in Brodmann 's area 9 revealed a consistent pattern and topography of neuronal labeling (Fig. 10). In anterior portions of the parhippocampal gyrus (area 28), only small numbers of labeled neurons were observed in the fundus of the rhinal sulcus in the transition area between areas 35 and 28 (Figs. 10A and 11B). Medially, the number of labeled neurons in the rhinal sulcus decreased markedly, and a few if any were found in area 28 proper. In more caudal coronal sections through the parahippocampal gyrus, the largest number of labeled cells was observed  near the occipitotemporal sulcus in area TF. The incidence of labeled cells was sharply lower in area TH (Fig. 10).\r\nThe laminar distribution of labeled neurons differed in each of the three parahippocampal areas examined. In area 28, HRP-reactive or fluorescently labeled cells were small to medium-sized pyramidal neurons concentrated in layer 4, although a few neurons were observed in layers 5, 6 and in the lower half of layer 3 (Fig. 11B). In area TH, labeled pyramidal neurons were sparsely distributed and were largely restricted to infragranular layers 5 and 6 with an occasional labeled neuron noted in layer 3 (Fig. 12A). In contrast, in area TF, near the occipitotemporal sulcus, many cells were found in layer 3 as well as in layers 5 and 6 (Fig 12B).\" (pp. 735, 737)\r\n\"Dorsal prefrontal connections with subicular, presubicular and transitional cortices\r\nIn all cases in which HRP or tritiated amino acids were injected into the cortex lining the PS, labeled axons could be traced throughout the medial pathway as it traveled within the cingulum bundle above the body of the corpus callosum and coursed around the splenium of the callsoum into the occipital lobe.Here, the prefrontal axons descended almost perpendicularly to the dorsal surface to reach the territory of the caudomedial lobule and the hippocampal formation. In both autoradiographic and HRP-reacted brains, terminal labeling was located in the molecular layer of the presubiculum (Figs. 8B and C). An interesting feature of the prefronto-presubicular terminal distribution in coronal sections was its disjunctive pattern, in which the terminals formed two discrete bands, 250-400 micrometer wide, that were separated and bordered by cell-free spaces (Fig. 13). This configuration could be followed in sequential sections and was reminiscent of ocular dominace stripes (Figs. 13A and C). Prefrontal terminals were never observed in the subiculum and, in fact, the junction of subiculum and presubiculum was sharply defined by the presence of prefrontal terminals in the latter. Within the presubiculum, a rostro-caudal gradient of prefrontal terminals was apparent with sparse terminal label at its most rostral levels and denser terminal labeling throughout the middle and caudal regions of this structure.\r\nBy far the most massive projection observed in this study was from the prefrontal cortex to the caudomedial lobule where fibers from the cingulum bundle swept into the core of the lobule (Figs. 8D and 14D-F). Terminals were distributed primarily in the deep layer and in the superficial cell-free layer of the caudomedial lobule, with only patchy terminal labeling observed between these two densely labeled lamina (Fig. 14D). At caudal levels labeled fibers formed columns extending throughout all cellular layers of the lobule (Figs. 14E and f). It is unclear whether this labeling represents terminal arborization of prefrontal afferents or fibers passing from the white matter core of the lobule to the outer-most layer. As in presubicular cortex, terminal labeling within the superficial layer exhibited spatial discontinuity.\r\nEvidence of reciprocal projections to prefrontal cortex were present in the cases with HRP implants or dye injections. At the level of the lateral geniculate ncucleus and the occipitotemporal  sulcus, scattered labeled neurons were found in the deep cell layer of the presubiculum and in the pyramidal layer in the medial third of this structure of the subiculum (Figs. 10B and C). Caudal to the lateral geniculate nucleus, the density labeled cells in the parahippocampal gyrus diminished greatly, and sections were frequently surveyed in which no labeled neurons were found. However, further caudally, in the caudomedial lobule, the density of labeled presubicular pyramidal cells exceeded that within any other region of the hippocampal formation (Figs. 10D, 15 and 16). Retrogradely labeled neurons were also preesnt in high density in th etransition cortex forming the ventrmedial wall of the lobul, where they assumed a bi-laminar configuration (Figs. 10D, 16A and C).

    "title": "Dual pathways connecting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the hippocampal formation in the rhesus monkey",
    "abstract": "Anterograde and retrograde tracing methods including autoradiography, horseradish peroxidase histochemistry and fluorescent dye transport were used to demonstrate that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is connected with the hippocampal formation and associated cortical regions by two distinct pathways. Fibers forming a lateral pathway travel in the fronto-occipital fasciculus and connect the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the fundus of the rhinal sulcus, posterior subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus, and the presubiculum. A larger medial pathway forms in the cingulum bundle and terminates in the most caudal part of the presubiculum, as well as in adjacent transitional cortices. These cortices form a caudomedial promontory that is located between the posterior cingulate and prestriate areas. In all allo- and mesocortical targets of prefrontal cortex, labeled terminals form banding patterns reminiscent of the columnar organization of afferent fiber columns in neocortex. The same cytoarchitectonic areas that receive prefrontal afferents issue reciprocal projections. The largest source is the caudomedial lobule including its presubicular portion. Neurons in the parahippocampal gyrus and adjacent presubiculum also are retrogradely labeled following implants of horseradish peroxidase or injection of fluorescent dyes into prefrontal cortex. In addition, subicular neurons project to the prefrontal cortex although the subiculum does not appear to receive prefrontal afferent input. These findings emphasize that multiple channels of communication link the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus via the parahippocampal gyrus, subiculum, presubiculum and adjacent transitional cortices. We speculate that each of these prefrontal projections may carry highly specific information into the hippocampus, whereas the reciprocal projections may allow retrieval by prefrontal cortex of memories stored in the hippocampus.",
