  "Title": "Dual streams of auditory afferents target multiple domains in the primate prefrontal cortex",
  "Abstract": "'What' and 'where' visual streams define ventrolateral object and dorsolateral spatial processing domains in the prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates. We looked for similar streams for auditory-prefrontal connections in rhesus macaques by combining microelectrode recording with anatomical tract-tracing. Injection of multiple tracers into physiologically mapped regions AL, ML and CL of the auditory belt cortex revealed that anterior belt cortex was reciprocally connected with the frontal pole (area 10), rostral principal sulcus (area 46) and ventral prefrontal regions (areas 12 and 45), whereas the caudal belt was mainly connected with the caudal principal sulcus (area 46) and frontal eye fields (area 8a). Thus separate auditory streams originate in caudal and rostral auditory cortex and target spatial and non-spatial domains of the frontal lobe, respectively",

      "Citation": "The primate cortical auditory system in the temporal lobe has a concentric organizaton15. The central core region, including primary auditory cortex, is located on the supratemporal plane and is encircled by secondary auditory cortices, the belt areas, which are bordered laterally by a parabelt region16–21 (Fig. 1a and b). The lateral belt areas can be distinguished from rimary auditory cortex by the presence of neurons with increased responsiveness to complex acoustic stimuli, including band-passed noise and species-specific vocalizations17, as opposed to to pure tones. Indeed, three cochleotopically organized fields separated by frequency reversals, termed nterolateral (AL), middle-lateral (ML) and caudolateral (CL) areas, are mapped within the lateral belt17. Electrophysiological studies of the superior temporal region in nonhuman primates suggests that its anterior and posterior aspects may differ functionally22,23.",
      "Comments": "Among other papers the author cites the paper HSK98a as a parcellation of auditory cortex. He uses also Figures from this paper so I assume, that he uses this brain mao. For the prefrontal Cortex there is no hint, which parcellation schem is used. It is similar to PG91b. Also Goldman-Rakic is one of the authors.",

    "abstract": "'What' and 'where' visual streams define ventrolateral object and dorsolateral spatial processing domains in the prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates. We looked for similar streams for auditory-prefrontal connections in rhesus macaques by combining microelectrode recording with anatomical tract-tracing. Injection of multiple tracers into physiologically mapped regions AL, ML and CL of the auditory belt cortex revealed that anterior belt cortex was reciprocally connected with the frontal pole (area 10), rostral principal sulcus (area 46) and ventral prefrontal regions (areas 12 and 45), whereas the caudal belt was mainly connected with the caudal principal sulcus (area 46) and frontal eye fields (area 8a). Thus separate auditory streams originate in caudal and rostral auditory cortex and target spatial and non-spatial domains of the frontal lobe, respectively",
